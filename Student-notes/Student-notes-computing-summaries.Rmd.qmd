The first half of this course emphasized data wrangling and visualization. When using data wrangling commands, summaries of data frames were computed using, naturally enough, the `summarize()` function. Typical summaries for quantitative variables include means, medians, standard deviations, maxima, minima, each of which applies to one variable at a time. For instance, this command calculates four summary statistics on the net running time recorded in the `TenMileRace` data frame:

```{r}
TenMileRace %>%
  summarize(mn = mean(net), middle = median(net), sd = sd(net), n = n())

```
