## Objectives

#. Show that including covariates in a prediction model always reduces in-sample mean square residual, but may not reduce residuals out-of-sample. 

#. Given regression coefficients, calculate model degrees of freedom and residual degrees of freedom.

#. Calculate amount of in-sample mean square error reduction to be expected with a useless (random) covariate. (Residual sum of squares divided by residual degrees of freedom.)
