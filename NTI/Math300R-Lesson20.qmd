## Objectives

#. Understand that gaming is a way of improving our skills and identifying potential opportunities and problems. 

#. Characterize the magnitude of random noise.

#. Distinguish between a sample, a summary of a sample, and a sample of summaries of samples.

## Reading

TBD




## Lesson

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Setup

The software for generating the simulations, and which contains a library of different scenarios, is in the package `{dagsim}`. The `{mosaic}` package contains functions for calculating statistics and **iteration**. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(dagsim)
```

## Example
1. Roll a die 1000 times. How often does each possible result appear?

```{r}
Sim <- dag_make(x ~ each(sample(1:6)))
Samp <- sample(Sim, size=100)
Samp %>% group_by(x) %>% summarize(count = n())
```


2. Generate 1000 rolls of the sum of two dice. How often does each possible result appear?

```{r}
Sim <- dag_make(x ~ each(sum(sample(1:6, 2, replace=TRUE))))
Sample <- sample(Sim, size=1000)
Sample %>%  
  dplyr::group_by(x) %>%
  summarize(frac = n()/nrow(.)) %>% 
  print.data.frame()
```

Question: What do your results tell you about the possible results when summing 2 dice? 

3. Do the same but for summing 6 dice. 

Question: What do your results tell you about the possible results when summing 6 dice? Do the data show you that it is possible to get a result of 36?  

This illustrates something about "inference": the data do not always point you directly to the truth.

Question: How would you modify the simulation to get a better handle on the truth.

## Measuring noise
Create a DAG where the X variable is simply noise: `eps()`

```{r}
Sim <- dag_make(x ~ eps())
Sample <- sample(Sim, size=100)
Sample %>% summarize(sd(x), mean(x))
```

- The argument to `eps()` sets the size of the noise. Confirm that this claim is true.
:::

Sometimes we will want to repeat a simulation over and over again, collecting the results. Use `do()` for this:

```{r}
# one trial
Sim <- dag_make(x ~ eps())
sample(Sim, size=100) %>% 
  summarize(sd(x), mean(x))

# five trials
do(5) *
  {sample(Sim, size=100) %>% 
  summarize(s = sd(x), m = mean(x))}
```

- Not all the rows are the same. Why not?
- None of the standard deviations are exactly 1. Does this mean the simulation is not working? 

A typical problem in statistical inference is to determine, from just one trial, whether the results are consistent or not with a proposed mechanism.
