A regression model can be formulated as a function that takes the explanatory variables as inputs and produces a value for the response variable as output.

SHOW `makeFun()` applied to a model producing a **model function**.

Effect size of an input is partial derivative of model function with respect to that input.

Effect size is a **rate**: the change in output per unit change in input. It's a measure of the size of a relationship.
