Use this from Section 19.4.1 of *Computational Probability and Statistics*?

> A US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: she is either innocent or guilty. Imagine you are the prosecutor. If we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, the null hypothesis is that the defendant is innocent and the alternative hypothesis is that the defendant is guilty. Your job as the prosecutor is to use evidence to demonstrate to the jury that the alternative hypothesis is the reasonable conclusion.

> The jury considers whether the evidence under the null hypothesis, innocence, is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person’s guilt. That is, the skeptical perspective (null hypothesis) is that the person is innocent until evidence is presented that convinces the jury that the person is guilty (alternative hypothesis).

> Jurors examine the evidence under the assumption of innocence to see whether the evidence is so unlikely that it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Notice that if a jury finds a defendant not guilty, this does not necessarily mean the jury is confident in the person’s innocence. They are simply not convinced of the alternative that the person is guilty.

> This is also the case with hypothesis testing: even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we typically do not accept the null hypothesis as truth. Failing to find strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to providing evidence that the null hypothesis is true.

> There are two types of mistakes possible in this scenario, letting a guilty person go free and sending an innocent person to jail. The criteria for making the decision, reasonable doubt, establishes the likelihood of those errors.
