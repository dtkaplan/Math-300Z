<p>Our method for modeling a real-world system is to identify a single response variable and treat that variable as a function of one, several, or many explanatory variables. Effect size (<a href="../Reading-notes/Reading-notes-lesson-24.html">Lesson 24</a>) lets you focus attention on an individual explanatory variable and how changes in that explanatory variable correspond to changes in the response variable.</p>
<p>Insofar as the logic of effect size is to isolate a single explanatory variable of interest, you might wonder why not build a model that conditions the response variable just on that one explanatory variable? As you’ll see, this is generally the wrong way to go about things. The role of each explanatory variable takes place in a context set by other explanatory factors.</p>
<p>The context-setting factors are called “<strong>covariates</strong>”. In the sense of data, covariates are perfectly ordinary variables. They are called covariates only to highlight the role of these variables for putting in context some other explanatory variables of particular interest to the modeler.</p>
<section id="example-covariates-and-context-in-educational-outcomes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-covariates-and-context-in-educational-outcomes">Example: Covariates and context in educational outcomes</h2>
<p>To illustrate how covariates set context, consider an issue of interest to public policy-makers in many societies: How much money to spend on children’s education? In the United States, for instance, educational budget policy is set mainly on a state-by-state level. State lawmakers are understandably concerned with the quality of the public education provided, but they also have other concerns and constraints and constituencies who give budget priority to other matters.</p>
<p>In evaluating the various trade-offs they face, lawmakers would be helped by knowing how increased educational spending will shape educational outcomes. What can available data tell us? Unfortunately, there are various political constraints that work against states adopting and publishing data on a common measure of genuine educational outcome. Instead, we have high-school graduation rates, student grades, etc. These have some genuine meaning but also can reflect the way the system is gamed by administrators and teachers and which cannot be easily compared across states. At a national level, we have college admissions tests such as the ACT and SAT. Perhaps because these tests are administered by private organizations and not state governments, it’s possible to gather data on test-score outcomes on a state-by-state basis and collate these with public spending information.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-sat-1">Figure&nbsp;1</a> shows average SAT score in 2010 in each state versus expenditures per pupil in public elementary and secondary schools. Laid on top of the data is a flexible linear model (and its confidence band) of SAT score versus expenditure. The overall impression given by the model is that the relationship is negative, with lower expenditures corresponding to higher SAT scores. But the confidence bands are broad and it is possible to find a smooth path through the confidence band that has almost zero slope. Either way, the conventional wisdom that higher spending produces better school outcomes is not supported by this graph.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1: State by state data (from 2010) on average score on the SAT college admissions test and expenditures for public education.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are other factors that play a role in shaping education outcomes: poverty levels, parental education, how the educational money is spent (higher pay for teachers or smaller class sizes? administrative bloat?), and so on. Modeling educational outcomes solely by expenditures ignores these other factors.</p>
<p>At first glance, it’s tempting to ignore these additional factors. We may not have data on them. And insofar as our interest is in understanding the relationship between expenditures and education outcomes, we are not directly concerned with the additional factors. This lack of direct concern, however, doesn’t imply that we should totally ignore them but that we should do what we can to “hold them constant”.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let’s consider a factor on which we do have data: the fraction of eligible students (those in their last year of high school) who actually take the test. This varies widely from state to state. In a poor state where few students go to college the fraction can be very small (Alabama 8%, Arkansas 5%, Mississippi 4%, Louisiana 8%). In some states, the large majority of students take the SAT (Maine 93%, Massachusetts 89%, New York 89%). In states with low SAT participation rates, the students who do take the test are applying to schools with competitive admissions. Such strong students can be expected to be get high scores. In contrast, the scores in states with high participation rates reflect both strong and weak students; they will be lower on average than in the low-participation states.</p>
<p>Putting the relationship between expenditure and SAT scores in the context of the fraction taking the SAT can be done by using fraction as a co-variate, that is, building the model <code>SAT ~ expenditure + fraction</code> rather than just <code>SAT ~ expenditure</code>. <a href="#fig-sat-3">Figure&nbsp;2</a>) shows a model with fraction taken into account.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div id="fig-sat-3" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="Reading-notes-lesson-28_files/figure-html/fig-sat-3-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2: The model of SAT score versus expenditures, including as a covariate the fraction of eligible students in the state who take the SAT.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that the effect size of spending on SAT scores is positive when the expenditure level is less than $10,000 per pupil. And notice that when the fraction taking the SAT is near 0, the average scores don’t depend on expenditure. This suggests that among elite students, expenditure doesn’t make a discernable difference: it’s the students, not the schools that matter.</p>
<p>The relationship shown in <a href="#fig-sat-1">Figure&nbsp;1</a> is genuine. So is the very different relationship seen in <a href="#fig-sat-3">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. How can the same data be consistent with two utterly different displays? The answer, perhaps unexpectedly, has to do with the connections among the explanatory variables. Whatever the relationship between each individual explanatory variable and the response variable, the <em>appearance</em> of that relationship will depend on how explanatory variables are connected to each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="connections-among-explanatory-variables" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connections-among-explanatory-variables">Connections among explanatory variables</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that the apparent relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable – for instance, school expenditures and education outcomes – depends on the connections of the explanatory variable with other explanatory variables, let’s move away from the controversies of political issues and study some systems where everyone can agree exactly how the variables are connected. We’ll look at data produced by simulations where we specify exactly what the connections are.</p>
<p>A simulation implements a hypothesis: a statement about that might or might not be true about the real world. As a starting point for our simulation, let’s imagine that education outcomes increase with school expenditures in a very simple way: each $1000 increase in school expenditures per pupil results in an average increase of 10 points in the SAT score: an effect size of 0.01 points per dollar. Thus, the imagined relationship is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{sat} = 1100 + 0.01 * \mbox{dollar expenditure}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s also imagine that the fraction of students taking the SAT test also influences the average test score with an effect size of -4 sat points per percentage point. Adding this effect into the simulation leads to an imagined relationship of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{sat} = 1100 + 0.01 * \mbox{dollar expenditure} - 4 * \mbox{participation percentage} .\]</span></p>
<p>And, of course, there are other factors, but we’ll treat their effect as random with a typical size of ± 50 points.</p>
<p>To complete the simulation, we’ll need to set values for dollar expenditures and participation percentage. We’ll let the dollar expenditures vary randomly from $7000 to $18,000 from one state to another and the participation percentage vary randomly from 1 to 100 percentage points.</p>
<p>Notice that in this simulation, both participation percentage and expenditures affect education outcomes, but there is no connection at all between the two explanatory variables. That is, the graphical causal network is that shown in Figure @ref(fig:school-sim-1).</p>

<p>The relationship between outcome and expenditure can be quantified by the effect size, which appears as the slope of the function. You can see that when the explanatory variables are unconnected, as in <a href="#fig-school-sim-1">Figure&nbsp;3</a>, the functions have the same slope.</p>
<p>Now consider a somewhat different simulation. Rather than expenditures and participation being unconnected (as in the causal diagram shown in <a href="#fig-school-sim-1">Figure&nbsp;3</a>), in this new situation we will posit a connection between the two explanatory variables. We’ll image that there is some broad factor, labeled “culture” in <strong>?@fig-school-sim-2</strong>, that influences both the amount of expenditure and the participation in the tests used to measure education outcome. For instance, “culture” might be the importance that the community places on education or the wealth of the community.</p>

<p>Since we know the exact mechanism in the simulation—<code>outcome</code> increases with <code>expenditure</code>—we know that model (b) matches the workings of the simulation while model (a) does not.</p>
<p>For the simulation where expenditure and participation share a common cause, failing to stratify on <code>participation</code> – that is, looking at the points in <span class="citation" data-cites="fig">@fig</span>:-school-data-2 (a) but ignoring color – gives an utterly different result than if the stratification includes <code>participation</code>.</p>

<p>It might be tempting at this point to conclude that your models should <em>always</em> include covariates. After all, for both simulations the model that included <code>participation</code> as a covariate gave the correct effect size of expenditures on outcomes. That turns out to be an over-simplification, as you’ll see in Learning Check XXX [about a collider].</p>

<section id="causality-correlation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causality-correlation">Causality &amp; Correlation</h2>
<p>Causality is about relationships among entities in the world, e.g.&nbsp;the immunological properties of the drug acetaminophen lead to a reduction in fever. Correlation is about relationships that are evident in data, which might or might not be due to direct causal connections. For example, people who take acetaminophen tend to have fever, but this is not because acetaminophen causes fever. Instead, people who are unwell, and perhaps have fever, are more likely to take acetaminophen than those who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Correlations are properly part of the evidence to support a claim or quantification of causation. Indeed, whenever there is a correlation between two variables, it’s likely that there is some chain of causal connections that links the two variables, even if that chain is not directly from one variable to the other. For instance, taking the flu vaccine is correlated with reduced mortality. Some of this correlation is due to the immunological properties of the vaccine itself. But some of the correlation results from healthy people being more likely to take the vaccine than sick people, and healthy people having a lower mortality than sick people.</p>
<p>Seen as a pessimist, this chapter can help you understand some of the ways that correlations can be present without a direct causal pathway, and how you can be badly mislead if you rely purely on data without any causal theory of the way your system works in the real world.</p>
<p>Seen as an optimist, this chapter is about ways of calculating effect sizes from data that allow you to incorporate knowledge of the causal connections amongst the variables in your data.</p>
<p>The field of statistics comprises both optimists and pessimists. Perhaps to oversimplify, the pessimists think the proper domain of statistics is data and stylized mathematical models, and ought not include speculative notions of causal connections in the real world. The only sort of causal connection that the pessimists will accept is that of the experimenter who <em>sets</em> the values of inputs, for example by giving one “<strong>treatment</strong>” group of patients a drug and another “<strong>control</strong>” group a “<strong>placebo</strong>”. This has been a highly productive attitude in statistics, resulting in the development of clever designs for experiments that give the most information with the least laboratory effort. Unfortunately, the no-causation-without-experimentation philosophy leaves us without recourse when working with a system where a controlled experiment is not feasible.</p>
<p>Perhaps the outstanding historical example of the limits of the no-causation-without-experimentation philosophy relates to the health effects of smoking. Nowadays, the morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco smoking is mainstream knowledge. Among the other proofs of the causal relationship is the decline in mortality due to lung cancer amoung populations where smoking became much less popular. Until the mid 1960s, however, some statisticians were in the vanguard of challenging the idea of a causal connection between smoking and, e.g., lung cancer. Notably, Ronald Fisher, generally considered to be the leading statistical figure of the 20th century, vehemently and influentially criticized the evidence for the causal connection.</p>

<p>The optimists, again to oversimplify, believe it is possible to make useful statements (e.g.&nbsp;“the class helped” in <a href="#fig-xkcd-correlation">Figure&nbsp;9</a>) about the causal connections that underlie data. They emphasize that statistics can support decision making even when knowledge of causation is incomplete and uncertain.</p>
<p>The optimists and the pessimists use the same set of mathematical and statistical tools for data analysis, particularly the calculation of effect sizes. The difference between them is the range of legitimate conclusions that can be drawn. The pessimists place in the center the idea that “correlation is not causation” and that <em>only</em> controlled experiment can be a justification for making causal conclusions. (We’ll study experiment in <a href="Reading-notes-lesson-32.html">Lesson 32</a>.) The optimists also see the difference between correlation and causation: correlation is a mathematical property, causation is a physical one. And the optimists accept that controlled experiment is an excellent way to form strong conclusions. But they accept other sources of knowledge or theoretical speculations as potentially useful, and use effect-size calculations in a way that, contingent on that knowledge or speculation, creates through the process of data analysis situations analogous to those created in the laboratory by careful experimentation.</p>
