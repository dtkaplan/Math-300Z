    "text": "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. – Matthew 7:7-8\nThe modeling techniques we’ve covered are surprisingly powerful at identifying patterns in data. With power comes responsibility. This chapter is about how spurious patterns can arise in data and processes you can use to help ensure that the patterns your models identify are genuine.\nIt’s well known that people are particularly adept at finding patterns. To see this, spend a minute or two with Figure 1, which shows x-y pairs generated by a complex mathematical procedure called the Mersenne-Twister algorithm. How many of the structures created by Mersenne-Twister algorithm can you identify by eye? Take five of the stronger-looking patterns: clusters of points, large empty areas, strings of dots, etc. Write down a list of the patterns you spotted, including the coordinate location of each, a short description (e.g. “arc of dots”), and your subjective sense of how strong or convincing that pattern is.\nWith your list in hand, look at Figure 2 at the end of this section, which displays another n = 1000 x-y pairs generated by the same mathematical procedure. You’re going to check which of the patterns you found in the testing data are confirmed by the training data. Go through your list, looking at each location where you found a pattern in the training data and checking whether a similar pattern appears at that location in the testing data.\nWere any of the patterns you saw in the training data confirmed by the testing data?\nThere’s no denying that the patterns you saw were in the data. But the Mersenne-Twister algorithm is specifically designed not to produce regular patterns. Any that you saw were accidental alignments in the particular sample of data from the algorithm.\nThe “patterns” abstractly referred to in the previous paragraphs appear in data. In data used for modeling, a pattern might be a relationship or correlation between two or more variables, or a cluster of rows in a data frame that have similar values for a response variable and explanatory variables.\nTraining models on data can encode the underlying patterns. For instance, a pattern in the data might result in a model generating detailed predictions or demonstrating a strong effect size of one variable on another.\nA valid pattern is one that steadily appears from one sample of data to another (so long as the sample is big enough). Such consistency suggests that the pattern reflects some genuine aspect of the system generating the data. A false or accidental pattern is one that appears in a sample of data, but is unlikely to show up in another sample. This inconsistency indicates that conclusions based on this pattern are unlikely to be applicable in the future or in new situations.\nThe obvious, direct way to check the validity of a pattern encoded by a model is to see if the same pattern occurs in new data, data that was not used in building the initial model. Lesson 22 took this approach by constructing a sampling distribution of a statistic such as an effect size. To create a sampling distribution, we train many models on different subsets of a data set.\nWhen working with prediction models, the sign of a valid pattern is that the quality of the predictions – perhaps measured with a root-mean-square-error or a sensitivity/specificity – remains consistent when we calculate it on new data. A prediction that shows very small error on the data used to train the model but large error on new data is not a prediction that we can rely on in new settings.\nThe historical rapid growth in data analysis activity and the construction of data sets with large numbers of explanatory variables has made it easier to capture with models both valid patterns and false patterns. This makes it important to recognize that the false detection of patterns is possible whenever you train a model, to be aware of the characteristics of models and data that make false detection more likely, and to adopt procedures to mitigate the risk that the results of your work may not generalize beyond the particular sample of data you have in hand."

    "text": "Example: Falsely discovering purchasing habits\nYou are a data scientist for an internet retailer, Potomac.com, which has just bought a national grocery chain, Austin Foods. You’re part of the team that is connecting the customer loyalty card data from Austin Foods with Potomac’s own large record of purchases. This is accomplished by offering a 10% Xdiscount for an item on Potomac to people who enter their Austin loyalty card number.\nPotomac’s management wants to create a cross-marketing program in which a customer shopping at Potomac will be offered coupons for Austin products. The hope is that the coupon discount will attract new customers to start shopping at Austin’s. In order for this to work, it’s best if the coupons are for products that the customer finds attractive.\nYour job is to build the coupon assignment system, that is, to figure out how to choose which products a customer is most likely to find attractive. To do this, you’ll create a set of classifiers that indicates the interest of a Potomac customer in an Austin product.\nYou’ve got data on 10,000 Potomac/Austin customers, that is, people whose records from Potomac and from Austin you can bring together. There are ten popular Austin products for which coupons can be offered. Among the 10,000 customers, about 16% have actually bought any given Austin product. You have built ten classifiers, one for each of the ten products. The input to the classifiers is 100 standard measures of a customer’s Potomac activity. The output of each classifier is the probability that the customer actually bought the corresponding Austin product.\nThe no-input classifier gives a probability of about 16% that the customer will buy the product. Management hopes that you will be able to segment the market to identify the products that a given person is much more likely to buy.\nIt’s a lot to ask of a person to sort through 100 potential explanatory variables to identify those that are predictive of buying a product. But it’s straightforward to use a model family that can learn on its own which variables are informative. You train the ten classifiers using a tree family of models.\n\nHeads up! The “data” has been created using random numbers, so that there are no actual relationships between the explanatory variables and the purchase outcomes. That is, no actual relationships aside from the accidental ones, such as the patterns encountered in Figure 1.\n\nTo illustrate how the coupon assignment system works, Table @ref(tab:some-results) shows an intermediate step in the calculation, where a probability for each of the ten products is calculated for each customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable @ref(tab:some-results) shows the output of the classifiers for just the first fifteen customers out of the 10,000 used to build the coupon selection system. For each person, all ten classifiers have been applied to estimate the probability that the person would buy each of the ten products. Highlighted in green are those products with a purchase probability greater than 40%.\nThe final output of the coupon assignment system is, for each customer, the identification of the specific products for which the probability is large. Reading Table @ref(tab:some-results), you’ll see that for person 1, product 9 merits a coupon. For person 2, products 2 and 10 merit a coupon. A winning product has not been identified for every customer, but you can’t please everyone.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'formattable'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:scales':\n\n    comma, percent, scientific\n\n\n\n\n(ref:some-results-cap)\n \n\n\nCustomer ID\n\n  \n    product \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n    9 \n    10 \n    11 \n    12 \n    13 \n    14 \n    15 \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    9 \n    13 \n    10 \n    13 \n    5 \n    13 \n    8 \n    7 \n    13 \n    5 \n    44 \n    15 \n    8 \n    13 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    16 \n    14 \n    7 \n    13 \n    11 \n    16 \n    13 \n    10 \n    11 \n    71 \n    8 \n    14 \n    73 \n    0 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    89 \n    13 \n    10 \n    13 \n    11 \n    12 \n    100 \n    12 \n    10 \n    11 \n    10 \n    8 \n    14 \n    0 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    9 \n    13 \n    22 \n    10 \n    14 \n    10 \n    3 \n    6 \n    12 \n    12 \n    12 \n    11 \n    14 \n    10 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    14 \n    3 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    8 \n    11 \n    11 \n    15 \n    10 \n    11 \n    11 \n    14 \n    0 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    16 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    64 \n    9 \n    25 \n    10 \n    8 \n    7 \n    5 \n    11 \n    11 \n    15 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    10 \n    5 \n    9 \n    69 \n    13 \n    20 \n    13 \n    8 \n    8 \n    13 \n    73 \n    20 \n    6 \n    10 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    14 \n    12 \n    15 \n    5 \n    4 \n    14 \n    13 \n    12 \n    4 \n    10 \n    14 \n    21 \n    14 \n    14 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n    62 \n    12 \n    12 \n    80 \n    9 \n    0 \n    9 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    9 \n    13 \n    6 \n    10 \n    12 \n    6 \n    17 \n    16 \n    6 \n    6 \n    25 \n    9 \n    5 \n    15 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:some-results-cap) The output of the ten classifiers for the first 15 customers.

But for the combinations with no coupon, the purchase rate was only 11%.\nThe results are impressive. For about half of the customers, the coupon assignment system has identified customers/product combinations with a purchase probability of more than 40%. Often, the probability of purchase is considerably higher than 40%. Targeting each customer with a coupon for the right product is likely to generate a lot of new sales!\n\nSince data was generated using random numbers, we know that the “success” of the coupon assignment system is illusory. Later, we’ll see how the process was able to uncover so many accidental patterns from random data and list some things to look out for when modeling. But first, let’s provide a reliable method for you to identify when your results are based in accidental patterns: using testing data.\n\nA true measure of the performance of a model should be based not on the data on which the model was trained, but data which have been held back for use in testing and not used in training. For this example, we’ll use testing data consisting of 10,000 customers for whom we have the same 100 explanatory variables from the Potomac database and for whom we know if each customer purchased any of the ten products from Austin Foods. Only about 1 in 6 customers bought any single product from Austin. We want to see if the classifier assigns a high probability to those customers who did buy the product. If so, it means we can use just the 100 explanatory variables to find winning products for customers for whom we have no Austin purchasing data.\n\n\nWarning: `as.tibble()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Please use `as_tibble()` instead.\nℹ The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.\n\n\nWarning: The `x` argument of `as_tibble.matrix()` must have unique column names if\n`.name_repair` is omitted as of tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Using compatibility `.name_repair`.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the tibble package.\n  Please report the issue at <\u001b]8;;https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues\u0007https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues\u001b]8;;\u0007>.\n\n\n\n\n(ref:purchase-test-cap)\n \n\n\nCustomer ID\n\n  \n    product \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n    9 \n    10 \n    11 \n    12 \n    13 \n    14 \n    15 \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    13 \n    7 \n    13 \n    17 \n    12 \n    8 \n    58 \n    13 \n    7 \n    7 \n    13 \n    9 \n    9 \n    13 \n    6 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    8 \n    19 \n    86 \n    13 \n    13 \n    9 \n    13 \n    18 \n    9 \n    75 \n    16 \n    13 \n    8 \n    13 \n    71 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    25 \n    12 \n    16 \n    0 \n    8 \n    10 \n    16 \n    10 \n    71 \n    8 \n    7 \n    80 \n    10 \n    10 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    15 \n    13 \n    12 \n    11 \n    10 \n    9 \n    17 \n    14 \n    8 \n    3 \n    17 \n    14 \n    12 \n    11 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    8 \n    10 \n    10 \n    38 \n    9 \n    13 \n    11 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    11 \n    9 \n    7 \n    14 \n    7 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    9 \n    10 \n    8 \n    60 \n    6 \n    4 \n    89 \n    9 \n    7 \n    11 \n    8 \n    10 \n    12 \n    8 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    9 \n    15 \n    6 \n    20 \n    8 \n    100 \n    5 \n    10 \n    10 \n    9 \n    9 \n    13 \n    72 \n    8 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    21 \n    12 \n    14 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    3 \n    11 \n    14 \n    13 \n    13 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    12 \n    9 \n    8 \n    9 \n    21 \n    6 \n    9 \n    71 \n    8 \n    8 \n    9 \n    8 \n    10 \n    9 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    12 \n    16 \n    14 \n    6 \n    10 \n    12 \n    15 \n    10 \n    9 \n    17 \n    19 \n    7 \n    12 \n    9 \n    8 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:purchase-test-cap) Similar to Table @ref(tab:some-results) but for the testing data.\n\n\n\nA valid evaluation of the performance of the system involves using the testing data rather than the training data. Figure @ref(fig:purchase-test) shows the assignment of coupons for the customers in the test data. Although coupons are assigned to these customers, the purchase rate for these items is only 16%, no different than the probability of purchase for no-coupon items. In other words, the coupon assignment system doesn’t work at all!"

    "section": "Sources of false discovery",
    "text": "Sources of false discovery\nHow did the coupon classifier system identify so many accidental patterns, patterns that existed in the training data but not in the testing data?\nOne source of false discovery stems from having multiple potential response variables. In the Potomac/Austin example, there were ten different classifiers at work, one for each of the ten Austin products. Even if the probability of finding an accidental pattern in one classifier is small, looking in ten different places dramatically increases the odds of finding something.\nSimilarly, having a large number of explanatory variables – we had 100 in the coupon classifier – provides many opportunities for false discovery. The probability of an accidental pattern between one outcome and one explanatory variable is small, but with many explanatory variables each being considered it’s much more likely to find something.\nA third source of false discovery at work in the coupon classifier relates to the family of models selected to implement the classifier. We used a tree model classifier capable of searching through the (many) explanatory variables to find ones that are associated with the response outcome. Unbridled, the tree model is capable of very fine stratification. Each coupon classifiers stratified the customers into about 200 levels. On average, then, there were about 50 customers in each strata. But there is variation, so many of the strata are much smaller, with ten or fewer customers. The small groups were constructed by the tree-building algorithm to have similar outcomes among the members, so it’s not surprising to see a very strong pattern in each group. For each classifier, about 15% of all customers fall into a strata with 20 or fewer customers.\nTo illustrate, Figure 3 shows the shape of the tree model for a typical coupon classifier. Each of the splits reflects an accidental alignment of the response variable with one of the explanatory variables. As more splits are made, the group of customers contained in the split becomes smaller. Many of the leaves on the tree contain just a handful of customers who accidentally had similar values for the several explanatory variables used in the splits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A sketch of one of the classifiers constructed for the coupon selection system. The tree-growing algorithm was allowed to keep going until the customer data was split up into very small strata.\n\n\n\n\nThe tree is too complex to be plausible as a real-world mechanism. None of the details in Figure 3 have any validity beyond the training data itself."

    "text": "Identifying false discovery\nWe use data to build statistical models and systems such as the coupon-assignment machine. False discovery occurs when a pattern or model performance seen with one set of data does not generalize to other potential data sets.\nThe basic technique to avoid false discovery is called cross validation. One simple approach to cross validation splits the data frame into two randomly selected non-overlapping sets of rows: one for training and the other for testing. Use the training data to build the system. Use the testing data to evaluate the system’s performance.\nMost often, cross validation is used to test model prediction performance such as the root-mean-square error or the sensitivity and specificity of a classifier. This can be accomplished by taking the trained model and providing as input the explanatory variables from the testing data, then comparing the model output to the actual response variable values in the testing data. Note that using testing data in this way does not involve retraining the model on the testing data.\nHow big should the training set be compared to the testing set? For now, we’ll keep things simple and encourage use of a 50:50 split or something very close to that.\nThis is a simple and reliable approach that should always be used."

    "text": "False discovery and multiple testing\nWhen the main interest is in an effect size, standard procedure calls for calculating a confidence interval on the effect. For example, a 2008 study examined the possible relationship between a woman’s diet before conception and the sex of the conceived child. The popular press was particularly taken by this result from the study:\n\nWomen producing male infants consumed more breakfast cereal than those with female infants. The odds ratio for a male infant was 1.87 (95% CI 1.31, 2.65) for women who consumed at least one bowl of breakfast cereal daily compared with those who ate less than or equal to one bowlful per week. [@fetal-sex-2008]\n\nThe model here is a classifier of the sex of the baby based on the amount of breakfast cereal eaten. The effect size tells the change in the odds of a male when the explanatory variable changes from one bowlful of cereal per week to one bowl per day (or more). This effect size is sensibly reported as a ratio of the two odds. A ratio bigger than one means that boys are more likely outcomes for the one-bowl-a-day potential mother than the one-bowl-a-week potential mother. The 95% confidence interval is given as 1.31 to 2.65. This confidence interval does not contain 1. In a conventional interpretation, this provides compelling evidence that the relationship between cereal consumption and sex is not a false pattern.\nBut the confidence interval is not the complete story. The authors are clear in stating their methodology: “Data of the 133 food items from our food frequency questionnaire were analysed, and we also performed additional analyses using broader food groups.” In other words, the authors had available more than 133 potential explanatory variables. For each of these explanatory variables, the study’s authors constructed a confidence interval on the odds ratio. Most of the confidence intervals included 1, providing no compelling evidence of a relationship between that food item and the sex of the conceived child. As it happens, breakfast cereal produced the confidence interval that was the most distant from an odds ratio of 1.\nLet’s look at the range of confidence intervals that can be found from studying 100 potential random variables that are each unrelated to the response variable. We’ll simulate a response randomly generated “sex” G and B where the odds of G is 1. Similarly, each explanatory variable will be a randomly generated “consumption” high or low where the odds of high is 1. A simple stratification of sex by consumption will generate the odds of G for those cases with consumption Y and also the odds of G for those cases with consumption N. Taking the ratio of these odds gives, naturally enough, the odds ratio. We can also calculate from the stratified data a 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio.\nSo that the results will be somewhat comparable to the results in @fetal-sex-2008, we’ll use a similar sample size, that is, n = 740. Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1) shows one trial of the simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:sex-consumption-1-cap)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n165\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n211\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:sex-consumption-1-cap) A stratification of sex outcome (B or G) on consumption (high or low) for one trial of the simulation described in the text.\nReferring to Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1), you can see that the odds of G when consumption is low is 182 / 182 = 1. The odds of G when consumption is high is 211/165 = 1.28. The 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio can be calculated. It is 0.95 to 1.73. Since that includes 1, the data underlying Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1) provide little or no evidence for a relationship between sex and consumption. This is exactly what we expect, since the simulation involves entirely random data.\nFigure 4 shows the 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio for 133 trials like that in Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1). The confidence interval from each trial is shown as a horizontal line. The large majority of them include 1. That’s to be expected because the data have been generated so that sex and consumption have no relationship except those arising by chance.\n\n\nWarning: geom_vline(): Ignoring `mapping` because `xintercept` was provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Confidence intervals on the odds ratio comparing female and male birth rates for many trials of simulated data with no genuine relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, out of 133 simulations there are six where the confidence interval does not include 1. These are shown in red. By necessity, one of the intervals will be the most extreme. If instead of numbering the simulations, we had labelled them with food items – e.g. grapefruit, breakfast cereal, toast – we would have a situation very similar to what seems to have happened in the sex-vs-food study. (For a more detailed analysis of the impact of multiple testing in @fetal-sex-2008, see @young-2009.)\nSuppose now that half of the data used in @fetal-sex-2008 had been held back as testing data. Using the training data, it would be an entirely legitimate practice to generate hypotheses about which specific food items might be related to the sex of the baby. The validity of any one selected hypothesis could then be established using the testing data without the ambiguity introduced by multiple testing. The testing data confidence interval can be taken at face value; the training data confidence interval cannot."

    "text": "Example: Organic discovery?\nIt’s easy to find organic foods in many large grocery stores. Advocates of an organic diet are attracted by a view that it is sustainable, promotes small farms, and helps avoid contact with pesticides. There are also nay-sayers who make valid points, but that is not our purpose here. Informally, I find that many people and news reports point to the health benefits of an organic diet. Usually they believe that these benefits are an established fact.\nA 2018 New York Times article observed:\n\nPeople who buy organic food are usually convinced it’s better for their health, and they’re willing to pay dearly for it. But until now, evidence of the benefits of eating organic has been lacking. [@NYT-2018-10-23-Rabin]\n\nThe new evidence of health benefits is reported in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine [@baudry-2018]\nDescribing the findings of the research, the Times article continued:\n\nEven after these adjustments [for covariates], the most frequent consumers of organic food had 76 percent fewer lymphomas, with 86 percent fewer non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and a 34 percent reduction in breast cancers that develop after menopause.\n\nThe study warrants being taken seriously: it involved about 70,000 French adults among whom 1340 cancers were noted. The summary of organic foot consumption was a scale from 0 to 32 and included 16 labeled products including dairy, meat and fish, eggs, coffee and tea, wine, vegetable oils, and sweets such as chocolate. Adjustment was made for a substantial number of covariates: age, sex, educational level, marital status, income, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, family history of cancer, body mass index, hormonal treatment for menopause, and others.\nYet … the reseach displays many of the features that can lead to false discovery. For instance, results were reported for four different types of cancer: breast, prostate, skin, lymphomas. The study reports p-values and hazard ratios1 comparing cancer rates among the four quartiles of the organic consumption index.\nComparing the most organic (average organic index 19.36/32) and the least organic (average index 0.72/32) groups the 95% confidence interval on the relative risk and p-values given in the study’s Table 4 are:\n\nBreast cancer: 0.66 - 1.16 (p = 0.38)\nProstate cancer: 0.61- 1.73 (p = 0.39)\nSkin cancer: 0.49 - 1.28 (p = 0.11)\nLymphomas: 0.07 - 0.69 (p = 0.05)\n\nYou might be surprised to see that the confidence interval on the relative risk for breast cancer includes 1.0, which suggests no evidence for an effect. As clearly stated in the report, the risk reduction for breast cancer is seen only in a subgroup of study participants: those who are postmenopausal. And even then, the confidence intervals continue to include 1.0:\n\nBreast cancer pre-menopausal: 0.67 - 1.52 (p = 0.85)\nBreast cancer post-menopausal: 0.53 - 1.18 (p = 0.18)\n\nSo where is the claimed 34% reduction in breast cancer cited in the New York Times article. It turns out the the study used two different indices of organic food consumption. The 0 to 32 scale which includes many items for which the amount consumed is very small (e.g., coffee, chocolate) and a “simplified, plant derived organic food score.” It’s only when you look at the full 0 to 32 scale that you see the reduction in post-menopausal breast cancer: the confidence interval is 0.45 to 0.96 (p = 0.03).\nWhat about cancer rates overall? For the 0 to 32 scale the risk ratio was 0.58 - 1.01 (p = 0.10). To see the claimed reduction clearly you need to look at the simplified food score which gives 0.63 - 0.89 (p < 0.005). And it’s only in comparing the highest-index quarter of participants with the lowerest quarter participants that any difference at all is seen in any type of cancer: the middle-half of participants show no difference in relative risk from the lowest-organic quarter of participants. (Because of this, had the study compared the highest quarter to the next highest quarter, they would have seen basically the same relative risks reported in the highest-to-lowest quarter comparison. Then the conclusion would have had a different flavor, perhaps to be reported as “Typical organic food consumption levels show no cancer benefits.”)\nA further source of potential false discovery stems from the study’s starting and stop times. It’s not clear that these were pre-defined; the reported results are intermediate to a longer follow up. The choice to report intermediate results is another way that the number of opportunities for false discovery is increased. And the choice is important: for the follow-up time used, about 2% of the participants developed cancer. In an earlier study of more than 600,000 middle-aged UK women (average age 59), the incidence of cancer was four times larger: 8.6%. [@bradbury-2014] That study did not find any relationship between organic food consumption and overall cancer rates, and found no relationship for 15 out of 16 different types of cancer. The exception is extremely interesting: non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which a similar result was found in the French study.\nSo is the study reported in the New York Times a matter of false discovery? It’s emotionally unsatisfying to discount a result about organic food and non-Hodgkin lymphoma simply because it’s part of a larger study that looked at many different combinations of cancer types and organic food indices. What if the researchers had only studied non-Hodgkin lymphoma – they would have gotten the same result and it wouldn’t have the deficiencies of being the strongest result of many possibilities. It would have stood on its own. But it doesn’t and we are left in a state of doubt."

    "section": "p-values and “significance”",
    "text": "p-values and “significance”\nFalse discovery is not a new problem. The traditional logic can be traced back to 1710, when John Arbuthnot was examining London birth records from 1629 to 1710. Arbuthnot was surprised to find that for each year males were more common than females. In interpreting this finding, Arbuthnot refered to the conventional wisdom that births of males and females are equally likely. If this were the case, in any one year there might, by chance, be more females than males or the other way around. While it’s theoretically possible that chance might produce the string of 82 years with more males, it’s very unlikely. “From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs,” Arburthnot wrote. In more modern language, Arburthnot concluded that the hypothesis of equal rates of male and female births was not consistent with the data. Arbuthnot’s “Chance” corresponds to false discovery, while “Art” is a valid discovery.\nArburthnot’s logic became a standard component of statistical method.\n\nSummarize the data into a single number called a “test statistic”. For Arburthnot the test statistic was the number of years where male births predominated, out of the 82 years being examined. The observed value of the test statistic was 82.\nState a “null hypothesis”, typically something that is the conventional wisdom. For Arburthnot, the null hypothesis was that male and female births are equally likely.\nCalculate a hypothetical quantity based on the null hypothesis: the probability that the test statistic produced in a world in which the null hypothesis holds true would be at least as large as the test statistic.\nIf the probability in (3) is small, one is entitled to “reject the null hypothesis.” Typically, “small” is defined as 0.05 or less.\n\nIn the 1890s, statistical pioneer Karl Pearson invented a test statistic he called \\(\\chi^2\\) (“chi”-squared, with “chi” pronounced “ki” as in “kite”) that can be applied in a variety of settings. In 1900, Pearson published a table [@pearson-1900] that makes it an easy matter to look up the probability in step (3) above. He called this theoretical probability “P”, a name that has stuck but is conventionally written as lower-case “p”.\nData scientists tend to work with “big data”, but for many applications of statistics, data is so scarce that use of separate training and testing data is impractical. For such small data, the calculation of a p-value can be a sensible guard against false discovery. Still, a p-value does not address any of the sources of false discovery outlined in the previous sections of this chapter. When used with small data and simple modeling methods, those sources of false discovery are not so much of a problem. In small data there won’t be multiple explanatory variables that can be searched and there won’t be a choice of response variables. This doesn’t eliminate all problems, since in small data results can depend critically on the inclusion or exclusion of a single row of data. The name “p hacking” has been given to the various ways that researchers can manipulate p-values to get them below 0.05.\nAnother problem with p-values stems from misinterpretation of the admittedly difficult logic that underlies them. The misinterpretations are encouraged by the use of the term “tests of significance” to the p-value method. Particularly galling is the use of the description “statistically significant” to describe a result where p < 0.05. The everyday meaning of “significant” as something of importance is in no way justified by p < 0.05. Instead, the practical importance or not is more clearly signaled by examining an effect size. (It’s extremely disappointing that journalists, who are writing for an audience that for the most part has no understanding of p-value methodology, use “significant” when reporting on the statistics of research findings. It would be more honest to use a neutral term such as “null-validated” or “p-validated” which does not confuse the statistical result with actual practical importance.)\nThe p-value methodology has little or nothing to contribute to data science practice. When data is big there is a much more straightforward method to guard against false discovery: cross validation. And when data is big there is another, more fundamental problem with p-values. They are calculated with reference to a specific null hypothesis of “no effect” or “no relationship.” More realistically, they should be calculated with respect to a hypothesis of “trivial (but potentially non-zero) effect”. There are all sorts of mechanisms in the world (such as common causes) that can create the appearance of some effect or relationship. No matter how trivial in size this is, with sufficient data the p-value will become small. To illustrate, Figure 5 shows the p-value as a function of the sample size n in a system with an R-squared of 0.001, which in most settings would be of no practical signficance.\n\n\nWarning: geom_hline(): Ignoring `mapping` because `yintercept` was provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The p-value as a function of sample size n when the test statistic R-squared has the trivial value 0.001. The horizontal line shows the usual threshold for “significance” of p < 0.05."

How accurate is such screening? Almost certainly, the accuracy is not as good as an extremely simple, no-input, alternative process: automatically identify every passenger as “not a security problem.” We can estimate the accuracy of the “not a security problem” classifier by guessing what fraction of airplane passengers are indeed a threat to aircraft. In the US alone, there are about 2.5 million airplane passengers each day and security problems of any sort rarely happen. So the accuracy of the no-input classifier is something like 99.999%.\nThe actual screening system, using metal detectors, baggage x-rays, etc. will have a lower accuracy. We know this since it regularly mis-identifies innocent people as security problems.\nThe problem here is not with airport security screening, but with the flawed use of accuracy as a measure of performance. Indeed, achieving super-high accuracy is not the objective of the security screening process. Instead, the objective is to deter security problems by convincing potential terrorists that they are likely to get caught before they can get on a plane. This has to do with the sensitivity of the system. The specificity of the system, although important to the everyday traveller, is not what deters the terrorist."

In each directory, the contents are split up on a lesson-by-lesson basis.\n\nObjectives: Student-facing learning goals that make explicit the skills and understandings that students are expected to develop in the course of each lesson. These files are formatted in a specific manner that provides an ID to each objective. Software reads the files so that each objective can be referred to in any document without duplication. That is, the files in this Objectives directory are the source of truth for the objectives for each of the revised lessons. Any edits or additions to the objectives must be performed in the files in this directory.\nNTI: Lesson-by-lesson “Notes To Instructors.” These are intended to guide instructors through each lesson. They usually contain references to the objectives stored in the Objectives directory. In draft form, the NTIs typically contain notes that are to be moved eventually to the “Reading notes.”\nLC: Like Objectives, this directory contains lesson-by-lesson exercises, styled “learning checks” in the style of the Statistical Inference via Data Science textbook. Not all the learning checks need to be assigned. Which ones are assigned for each lesson will be noted in the NTIs.\nReading-notes: Textbook-like readings, also organized lesson-by-lesson (as opposed to the chapter organization typically found in textbooks.) Often, several lessons in sequence refer to the same statistical topic. Nonetheless, the reading notes are divided on a lesson basis.

    "text": "Background\nUp through Spring 2022, Math 300 was organized around the Moore and Notz textbook: Statistics: Concepts and controversies 10/e. This book was designed for a non-technical audience of “consumers of statistics” but is dramatically outdated. For instance, it has no data science content and introduces only primitive statistical methods. A course with such shortcomings seems inappropriate for cadets going on to be officers who will inevitably have to work with modern data and methods.\nIn Fall 2022, Math 300 switched to a very different book, Ismay and Kim, Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse. The ModernDive book introduces computing on data in an accessible but modern way. It is the only well-known statistics text based on a data-science perspective. Nonetheless, the statistical inference portions of the book regress to the same sort of primitive statistical methods from Concepts and Controversies.\nTo support the Fall 2022 course using ModernDive, a complete set of roughly 35 Notes to Instructors (NTI) was written by Prof. Bradley Warner along with problem sets and other needed materials and deployed for the course.\nThis proposal is for additional improvements to Math 300, building on the Fall 2022 course but replacing the statistical inference portions of the course with more contemporary and general-purpose inference techniques and support for concepts and methods relevant to decision-making.\nIn the following, I refer to three different versions of Math 300:\n\nThe Fall 2022 version of the course, using the ModernDive book, will be called Math 300.\nThe previous version of the course, as taught for several years before Fall 2022, will be called 300CC, which refers to the textbook then used, Concepts & Controversies.\nThe course proposed in this document, a revision of part of Math 300, will be called Math 300R. The R stands for “revised.”"

    "text": "Statistical topics and framework\nTransitioning from Math 300CC to Math 300 has already accomplished many data science goals. This proposal centers on the statistical topics/methods to be covered and the path through them.\nThe class-time demands of the new emphasis on data science techniques in Math 300 (and retained in Math 300R) dictate that the statistical concepts and methods be taught more compactly than in Math 300CC. Low-priority, legacy topics from Math 300CC should be dropped. (The GAISE report provides some guidance here.) We can use to advantage that students in Math 300 already see many modeling-related topics in Math 141Z/142Z. Since students already have a background in model-building and computing, we can choose statistical topics that relate well to decision-making.\nA traditional path for statistical methods starts with descriptive statistics (e.g., standard deviation) and then presents “1-sample” statistics (e.g., mean, proportion) and inferential techniques (confidence interval, hypothesis test) in that context. Next comes the inferential techniques for the analogous “2-sample” statistics (difference in mean, difference in proportion), followed by inference techniques for regression.\nThis path is unnecessarily long for our students since regression encompasses all the traditional methods.1 Framing statistical inference in the context of regression avoids the need to teach method-specific calculations or cover the variety of formats for non-regression test results. Regression is part of the data scientist’s standard toolbox and relates well to more advanced data techniques such as machine learning. The ModernDive textbook uses regression as the segue from the first block (about data wrangling and visualization) to the third block (about inference).\nAdditional streamlining comes from motivating statistical inference using a simulation approach. Simulation draws on two conceptually simple data operations: resampling and permutation (shuffling). This approach is well established in the statistics community and is considered by many (including the ModernDive authors) to be a better pedagogy than the traditional formula-and-distribution presentation of statistical methods. Since Math 300 (and 300R) students will already have worked with wrangling and visualization, they will be well prepared to work with the data generated by repeated simulation trials.\nThe focus on decision-making in 300R appears in the addition of new concepts and techniques treated minimally in traditional statistics courses. These include risk, prediction (and its close cousin classification), causality, and confounding. Introductory epidemiology courses provide a model for teaching about risk, causation, and confounding. The pedagogy for these topics in Math 300R comes from the epidemiology course I introduced at Macalester. In addition, Math 300R draws on my decade of experience teaching causality as part of an introductory statistics course. (See the causation chapter of my Statistical Modeling text.)\nThe Statistical Modeling pedagogy for causality uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and causal simulations based on them. Unlike resampling and permutation, which re-arrange existing data, the DAG simulations generate synthetic data with specified properties (such as effect sizes). Simulations allow a concrete demonstration of the extent to which regression techniques can and cannot recover causal information from data.\nThe DAG-simulation approach lends itself naturally to the demonstration of statistical phenomena such as sampling variation and estimation of prediction error. As an example, consider the statistical fallacy of regression to the mean, as with Galton’s finding about comparing children’s heights to their parents’. The natural hypothesis that heights are determined by genetic and other factors is represented by this DAG:\n\\[\\epsilon \\rightarrow parent \\longleftarrow GENES \\longrightarrow child \\leftarrow \\nu\\]\nIn this DAG there is no causal mechanism included for “regression to the mean.” However, Galton’s empirical finding is replicated by data from the DAG-simulation."

(Exception: revisions to Math 300 the Fall 2022 teaching team deems appropriate. Such revisions are not part of this proposal.)\nThe following 19 lessons are entirely refactored and based on new readings, NTIs, exams, and other materials. Objectives for each of these 19 lessons are itemized here.\n\nThe corresponding ModernDive chapters are not used in Math 300R.\nThe software used is the same as that used in the first half of the ModernDive book, specifically the ggplot2 graphics package and the tidyverse data wrangling packages. However, the infer package used in the second half of ModernDive is dropped.\n\nThe theme of the refactored 19 lessons is “informing decisions with data.” Statistical approaches that can inform decision-making include anticipating the impact of interventions, predicting individual outcomes, and the quantification of risk. These are all included in Math 300R.\nTopics to be de-emphasized are the algebra of computing confidence intervals and p-values and the (controversial) role of p-values as a guide to practical “significance.” About half of a traditional course is about the construction of confidence intervals in various settings and, more or less equivalently, the conversion of data into p-values. However, in the contemporary era, when “observational” data are collected en masse, p-values can become very small (“significant”) even when the relationship under study is slight and insubstantial.\nConfounding and methods for dealing with it (statistical adjustment, experiment) are treated substantially in Math 300R. Decision-making about interventions often relies on understanding causal effects. The possibility of confounding is a major source of skepticism about making causal judgments. In a world where much data is observational, the sweeping principles that “correlation is not causation” and “no causation without experimentation” do not support making responsible conclusions about causal connections and the need to make decisions even when data cannot provide a definitive answer. Decision-makers need this support."

    "section": "Rationale for course revisions",
    "text": "Rationale for course revisions\n\nRelationship to Math 357 and Math 377\nDFMS offers three courses satisfying the statistics component of the Academy’s core requirements: Math 300, Math 357, and Math 377. In designing 300R, attention should be paid to the reasons for supporting three distinct courses. The catalog copy lays out the differences in terms of intended student major, software, mathematical background, and orientation to data science.\nIntended student major: The catalog says, “Math 300 is designed primarily for majors in the Social Sciences and Humanities.” while “Math 356 is primarily designed for cadets in engineering, science, or other technical disciplines. Math majors and Operations Research majors will take Math 377.” Math 377 is also the intended course for prospective Data Science majors, although this is not in the catalog.\nSoftware: The catalog does not describe any software component for either Math 300 or Math 357, but states that, in Math 377, “modern software appropriate for data analysis will be used.” In reality, as of Fall 2022, much the same software is used in all three courses: R with the dplyr package for data wrangling, ggplot2 for data visualization, and “R/Markdown” for creating computationally active documents.\nOne difference between Math 300 and 357/377 relates to computer programming. Both 357 and 377 include content about the underlying structure of the R language, object types, the construction of functions, and arrays and iteration. In contrast, Math 300 is based on a small set of command patterns using data frames. Students see R in Math 300 more or less as an extension of what they learned in 141Z/142Z; what’s added is a few statistical and data-wrangling functions and a handful of new graphics types.\nStudents’ mathematical background: Math 377 explicitly refers to “calculus-based probability.” Math 300 and 357 share identical catalog copy, though in reality Math 357 and Math 377 use the same textbook. Calculus is indeed necessary for the probability topics in Math 357 and 377. My interpretation is that Math 300 should serve as a safe haven for those who lack confidence in their calculus skills. Both the Fall 2022 edition of Math 300 and the proposed Math 300R serve this role as safe haven.\nOrientation to Data Science: Starting with the Fall 2022 edition, Math 300 develops and draws on data-science skills for wrangling and visualization. In this, the new Math 300 is in line with both Math 357 and 377.\nThe above analysis indicates that Math 300 and 300R should diverge from Math 357/377 in these ways:\n\nMath 300R should make little or no use of calculus operations.\nMath 300R should include little consideration of probability distributions or (non-automated) calculations with any but the simplest.\nMath 300R should be computational, but should not draw heavily on computer programming skills such as types of objects, arrays, indexing, and loop-style iteration. Use of R/Markdown documents should be considered as a pedagogical choice, and retained or discontinued based on how it contributes to student success in the other areas of the course.\n\nIn addition, I suggest that …\n\nMath 300R include some work with assembling/curating data using spreadsheets and basic data cleaning with spreadsheets. Awareness of the ubiquity of data errors and a basic understanding of how to deal with such errors is an important component of working with data. (This is not to suggest that data analysis, modeling, and graphical depiction be taught using spreadsheets, which are notoriously unreliable, difficult, and limiting for such purposes. Spreadsheets are, however, appropriate for the phase where non-tabular data is transcribed into a tabular arrangement.)\n\n\n\nInstitutional goals\nIt can be difficult to translate broadly stated institutional goals to apply them to a single course. However, catalog descriptions of programs and individual courses provide some assistance. Here is the catalog copy for Math 300 (which is identical to the catalog description of Math 357).\n\nMath 300. Introduction to Statistics. An introduction in probability and statistics for decision-makers. Topics include basic probability, statistical inference, prediction, data visualization, and data management. This course emphasizes critical thinking among decision-makers, preparing future officers to be critical consumers of data. (Emphasis added.)\n\nI interpret the final sentence as a description of the overall objective of the course:\n\nOverall objective: Prepare officers to use data to inform decisions.\n\nReturning to the idea that the topics listed in the catalog copy ought to be interpreted as serving the overall objective of the course, let’s consider those topics one at a time:\n\ndata management\ndata visualization\nprediction\nstatistical inference\nbasic probability\n\n\nStrictly speaking, as a term of art the phrase “data management” is business jargon describing enterprise-level activities that are unrelated to the other items on the list. It would be unheard of to include it, in this strict sense, in a statistics course. I believe the intent of the phrase to be better served by terms like “data wrangling,” “data cleaning,” “database querying,” and such which make up an important part of “data science.” Data wrangling is a major feature of Math 300 launched and is covered using professional level computing tools well suited to both small and large data. But whatever “data management” might reasonably be taken to mean, it was utterly ignored in Math 300CC.\n“Data visualization” is generally taken to be the process of using graphics to discover and highlight patterns shown in data. Math 300CC included only statistical graphics such as histograms, box-and-whisker plots, and basic “scatter plots.” Math 300 adds to this modern modes of graphics such as transparency, color, and faceting that make it possible to display relationships among multiple variables. The software used in Math 300 is the professional-level ggplot2 which provides the ability to increase the sophistication and generality of data display, using for example density graphics such as violin plots. As such, Math 300 is a big step on the road to rich data visualization. Some of these will be introduced in Math 300R in the second half of the course.\n“Prediction” is a central paradigm used in the important area of “machine learning.” It is also an often used method used to inform decision making and characterize risk, for instance, by indicating the distribution of plausible outcomes. Math 300CC emphasized paradigms such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals that are not aligned with making and interpreting predictions. Math 300 focuses on these same paradigms. Math 300R will treat prediction as a central statistical path, as well as highlighting its proper use, interpretation, and evaluation.\n“Statistical inference” is traditionally taken to mean the calculation and interpretation of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals in various simple settings. Such settings include the “difference between two means,” the “correlation coefficient,” and the “slope of a regression line.” Math 300CC introduced a handful of such settings, providing distinct formulas for each of them. The “controversies” referred to in the title Concepts and controversies includes the problematic interpretation of “p-values” and the need to use random sampling and/or random assignment in data collection to get “correct” results. Math 300 retains the emphasis on confidence intervals and p-values in the simple settings, but emphasizes a more general and accessible methodology based on bootstrapping and permutation tests.\n\nUnfortunately, appealing to random sampling/assignment is often whistling past the graveyard, since these idealized data collection processes are rarely available. Instead, professionals include “covariates” in their data collection in order to “adjust” for the factors that would have been scrambled into insignificance by random sampling/assignment if it had been available. Math 300R incorporates covariate methods and highlights the importance of identifying appropriate covariates.\n\n“Basic probability” can mean different things to different people. In most introductory statistics courses it refers to the construction, calculation, and study of named distributions such as the binomial, normal, chi-squared, t, etc. Such distributions play an important role in the statistical theory of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. That is, they are support for statistical inference. Math 300CC followed the traditional pattern of having students memorize which distribution is relevant to which setting and using printed tables for calculation. As described earlier, Math 300 provides a much more natural route to inference through bootstrapping and permutation tests.\n\nWhat’s left out in this conception of basic probability is the support for decision making. Essential to this is the proper use of “conditional probability.” Math 300R emphasizes appropriate use and interpretation of conditional probability, seen most clearly in the “classifiers” part of the course.\n\n\nFaculty opinions\nInsofar as faculty internalize the goals of the institution, their views can point to ways that existing courses do and do not reflect those goals.\nWithin DFMS and other departments, there is a general discontent that Math 300CC was not doing what it ought to. Reasons for this can be seen by examining the textbook used in Math 300CC. The book has clear deficiencies, among which are:\n\nthe material is out of date and does not reflect any of the consensus recommendations (such as GAISE) developed in the last 30 years.\nit does not use data at any level beyond hand calculation.\nit does not deal with decision making at any serious level. (The only decision formally supported is whether or not to reject the Null hypothesis.)\n\nThe opinions of faculty outside DFMS can also be an important guide to institutional priorities. In AY 2021-22 I contacted the departments in the social sciences and humanities. Three of these—history, political science, economics—responded with interest. Discussion with groups of faculty from these departments elucidated a number of points:\n\nThe faculty most highly valued the development of data-science skills such as computing for data wrangling and data visualization.\nThe then-current version of Math 300 did not contribute to the development of such skills.\nMath 357 is not seen as an appropriate alterative to Math 300, both because of perceived difficulty of 357 and because faculty do not value the emphasis on probability distributions seen in 357.\n\nFrom my experience at Macalester and in conducting reviews at many colleges, I am often wary of the motivation of faculty in other departments. These can represent a desire for service courses like Math 300 to cover discipline-specific techniques. However, the faculty I spoke to also had an eye on what their students will need for their post-graduation jobs. Particularly the USAF officers drew on their field experience in areas such as military intelligence.\nBased on these findings, the group of faculty planning for revisions to Math 300 made an easy decision: replace the textbook with one oriented to data science. We selected the ModernDive book, which is unique among introductory statistics textbooks in starting out with data wrangling and visualization. This change of textbook addresses the “use data” part of the course objective stipulated above.\nThe other part of the objective—inform decisions—remains problematic even with the switch in the Math 300 textbook. Discussions I had with the ModernDive authors made clear that their purpose in writing the book was to provide a way to introduce data science into introductory statistics, but that they stuck to the traditional hypothesis-testing/confidence-interval framework in order not to make the change too daunting for instructors thinking of adopting the text. In other words, they were not trying to turn the topic toward decision-making with data, the motivation of the ideas presented in this proposal for Math 300R."

There should accordingly be a “null” relationship between d and the others. On the other hand, b and c are connected (although the connection is confounded with a).\nLet’s model d by b and look at the p-value:\n\nSample <- sample(dag07, size=50)\nlm(d ~ b, data=Sample) %>% broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   0.0556    0.132      0.422   0.675\n2 b            -0.121     0.0985    -1.23    0.225\n\n\nThe p-value on the b coefficient is large, greater than the usual threshold of 0.05.\nOn the other hand, b and c are connected and the p-value (with this much data) is tiny.\n\nlm(c ~ b, data = Sample) %>% broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   -0.106     0.151    -0.705 4.84e- 1\n2 b             -1.55      0.113   -13.8   2.52e-18\n\n\nImagine a setting where a popular (but unproven!) hypothesis has emerged: that b and d are really related. 100 different research teams rush in to be the first to demonstrate, each generating their own experimental data. We’ll simulate this and collect the summary of the b coefficient w.r.t. d. [First show the statement without the do() to show what each row looks like. Then run the 100 trials and look for small p-values]\n\nAll_groups <- do(100) * {\n  lm(d ~ b, data=sample(dag07, size=50)) %>% \n  broom::tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == 'b')\n  }\n\nDid any of the groups get a “significant” result?\n\nAll_groups %>% \n  filter(p.value < 0.05)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n  term  estimate std.error statistic p.value  .row .index\n  <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl> <int>  <dbl>\n1 b        0.298    0.105       2.84 0.00651     1     42\n2 b       -0.199    0.0889     -2.24 0.0297      1     76\n3 b        0.232    0.0934      2.48 0.0166      1     78\n4 b       -0.211    0.0989     -2.14 0.0375      1     99\n\n\nIn the context of 100 trials being done, it’s understandable that some of the groups happened to get a p-value < 0.05. But suppose that only the groups with small p-values publish their results? Then it looks as if they found a “significant” result.\nHow can we guard against this accidental generation of significant results? The standard answer in scientific work is to replicate the result: the labs should try again to confirm the result they got in the first study. (In practice, there are strong social/financial/career pressures against conducting such replications. These need to be overcome to guard against false discovery.)\nHere’s a simulation where each lab group runs the study twice. Do any get small p-values both times?\n\nReplicated_groups <- do(100) * {\n  do(2) * {\n    lm(d ~ b, data=sample(dag07, size=50)) %>% \n      broom::tidy() %>%\n      filter(term == 'b')\n    } %>% .$p.value\n} \nPairs <- Replicated_groups %>% \n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = .row, values_from = result)\nPairs %>% filter(`1` < 0.05, `2` < 0.05)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 3\n# … with 3 variables: .index <dbl>, 1 <dbl>, 2 <dbl>\n\n\nA better approach. As a rule of thumb, once you have a sample size \\(n\\) that gives a genuine p \\(\\approx 0.05\\), doubling \\(n\\) should reduce p by a factor of about 10. But if p is merely accidentally small, doubling the sample size won’t have any effect.\nA demonstration when there is a genuine relationship:\n\nlm(c ~ a, data = sample(dag07, size=5)) %>% broom::tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == 'a')\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  term  estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 a         1.63     0.968      1.68   0.191\n\nlm(c ~ a, data = sample(dag07, size=10)) %>% broom::tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == 'a')\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  term  estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 a        0.957     0.585      1.64   0.141\n\n\nLet’s re-run the simulation with \\(n\\) doubled, that is, size=100 compared to the previous size=50\n\nBigger_n <- do(100) * {\n  lm(d ~ b, data=sample(dag07, size=100)) %>% \n    broom::tidy() %>%\n    filter(term == 'b')\n  }\n\nAre these p-values smaller than in the trials with size=50?"

    "text": "Lesson\nThis lesson marks the beginning of a new phase of the course. Thus far, we’ve worked with techniques* for data wrangling, graphics, and regression modeling. Now we address the question of what a regression model (and other information that we might have) can tell us about the real world.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nlibrary(mosaicData)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuided activity: House prices\n\n\n\nHave students do the calculations for the first model, answering the questions that follow. After this is complete, have students do the calculations for the second model and answer those questions.\nThe mosaicData::SaratogaHouses data frame contains information about the sales price and various attributes of about 1700 houses. (See ?SaratogaHouses for a detailed description.)\nDo a regression of price ~ bedrooms and explain what the regression coefficients mean.\n\nlm(price ~ bedrooms, data=SaratogaHouses) |> coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)    bedrooms \n   59862.96    48217.81 \n\n\n\nWhat are the units of the intercept and of the bedrooms coefficient? *Intercept in dollars, bedrooms in dollars per bedroom.\nInterpret what the coefficients indicate about the price of houses and bedrooms. Each additional bedroom adds about $50000 to the value of a house.\nAccording to the model, predict what would be the sales price (at the time the data was collected, 2006) of a house with two bedrooms? \\(59863 + 2\\times 48218\\)\n\nOf course, bedrooms are not the only important thing about a house. Let’s include livingArea along with bedrooms in the model.\n\nlm(price ~ livingArea + bedrooms, data=SaratogaHouses) |> coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)  livingArea    bedrooms \n  36667.895     125.405  -14196.769 \n\n\n\nWhat are the units of the livingArea coefficient? dollars per square foot\nWhat does this model say about the value of adding a bedroom? It seems to reduce the value of the house by about $15,000.\n\nBased on exactly the same data, the two models seem to give contradictory statements about the value of an additional bedroom.\n\nIs one model right and the other wrong? If so, which one is right? (Explain your reasoning.) Both models are mathematically correct. But they need to be interpreted in different ways. Each is telling us something different about the real world.\nCould both models be right? If so, explain why the bedroom coefficients have opposite signs. We will need to develop some additional tools and concepts before we can take on this question.\n\nLearning how to interpret models in terms of what they say about the world is a major theme of this second half of Math 300.\nAnother, more technical question that we will address has to do with the precision of coefficients like 125.40 dollars per square foot. Might it actually be $200/ft2? How about $500/ft2? And how seriously should we take the sales value that we calculate by setting numbers for bedrooms and livingArea into the model?"

    "text": "Lesson\nIn Lesson 33 we built a classifier based on simulated data from dag10.\n\nA classifier is a function of the variables deemed relevant by the designer and that produces a yes/no output.\nDiscovering a suitable function requires insight and usually trial and error.\n\nHere’s a classifier relevant to dag10:\n\nC1 <- make_classifier(c1 ~ b < 0)\n\nC1 is a function taking a data frame as input. The calculation is whether b is less than 0. If so, the function output is a 1. The output will be added as column c1 to the input data\nTo evaluate it, create a dataframe from dag10 and run the classifier on it.\n\nSample <- sample(dag10, size=1000) %>% C1()\nwith(Sample, table(y, c1))\n\n   c1\ny     -   +\n  0 368 125\n  1 131 376\n\n\nThe false-positive rate is 125/1000, the false-negative rate is 131/1000. The “accuracy” is (368+376)/1000, about 74%.\nWe designed classifier C1() using where the disease state is 1 about half the time, as appropriate for a case-control design.\n\nSample %>% summarize(yesses = mean(y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  yesses\n   <dbl>\n1  0.507\n\n\nNow we want to deploy the classifier in a realistic setting, where the base rate is only, say, 10%. To simulate this, we’ll keep all of the 0s from the simulation, but only 11% of the 1s.\n\nField_results <- sample(dag10, \n                        size=1000, \n                        survive=~ifelse(y==1, unif() < 0.11, TRUE)) %>% C1()\nwith(Field_results, table(y, c1))\n\n   c1\ny     -   +\n  0 683 225\n  1  23  69\n\n\nThe false negative rate is now close to zero: 19/1000. But the false positive rate is 31%, much higher than with the case-control data used to design the classifier.\nWhat’s gone wrong? Why did the false positive rate change?\nThe reason is that the “base rate” (or prevalence) for the disease is 10.1% in dag10b compared to the 50% in dag10. Same classifier, but a different false positive rate.\nWe would like to have a way to characterize a classifier that is independent of the base rate.\nThe false positive rate is a probability: p(0 & +). Similarly, the false negative rate is p(1 & -). We can read these off the table.\nThe quantities of interest to the patient and doctor are different probabilities:\n\np(0 | -) — probability you don’t have the disease given a negative test result\np(1 | +) — probability you have the disease given a positive test result\n\nCalculate these probabilities from the classifer test results for the two base rates we’ve looked at: 50% for dag10 and 21% for dag10b.\n\nCase/control — p(0 | -) is 368/(368 + 131) = 73%\nField – p(0 | -) is 759/(746 + 29) = 96%\nCase/control — p(1 | +) is 376/(376 + 125) = 75%\nField – p(1 | +) is 88/(248+88) = 26%\n\nThese patient-centered probabilities change as the base rate changes. It turns out that the proper way to characterize the classifier is with two different probabilities:\n\nSensitivity: Probability of a + test if you have the disease: p(+ | 1)\nSpecificity: Probability of a - test if you do not have the disease: p(- | 1)\n\nNote that these are not probabilities of direct interest to the patient or doctor. But they do come out the same regardless of the base rate of the disease.\n\nCase/control — p(+ | 1) is 376/(376+131) = 74%\nField – p(+ | 1) is 88/(29+88) = 75%\nCase/control — p(- | 0) is 368/(368 + 125) = 75%\nField – p(- | 0) is 746/(746+248)= 75%\n\nGiven the sensitivity/specificity and the base rate, we can calculate the probability of interest to the patient\np(1 | +) = p(+ | 1) p(1) / (p(+ | 1)p(1) + p(-|0)p(0))\nIn statistics, the sensitivity/specificity is called the “likelihood function”, the probability of the observed data under the actual values in the world. THIS IS WEAK."

    "text": "Lesson\n\nRisk\nIntroduce words related to “risk” and try to convert them into seeing a continuum of “risk” to “opportunity,” that is, uncertain outcomes that could be positive or negative. (“Risk reduction,” “volatility,” “gain,” “gambling”).\nEach risky outcome is quantified by two numbers: a probability, and a value. It’s easiest to talk about the value measured in dollars, but there of course other scales: “lives (lost or saved),” “years of life,” “happiness,” “satisfaction,” etc. Unfortunately, we don’t have standard numerical scales for these.\n(Epidemiologists have a scale for quantifying health outcome: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) which would take a class session on its own to explain, but which is highly instructive.)\nA “loss function” takes as input a possible outcome of an uncertain event and produces as output a value, which we might measure in dollars or QALYs or lives, etc. For the sake of definiteness, denote a loss function as \\(L(\\cal O)\\), where \\(\\cal O\\) is an outcome of the uncertain event. In quantifying loss, each possible outcome \\(\\cal O\\) is associated with a probability. Let’s call this \\(p(\\cal O)\\). Mathematical philosophers have been arguing since the mid 1600s about what exactly is meant by probability. Don’t expect a resolution to this quandry. For our purposes, it suffices to think about a probability of an outcome in the context of a prediction model, using the tools from Lesson 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Ice cream sales\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, imagine the situation of an ice-cream pushcart vendor. If it is cold or rainy, sales will be slight. If it’s beautiful and hot, sales will be high. Help the students construct a plausible “loss” function: sales versus temperature.1 Then generalize that into a function with two inputs, say, raininess and temperature. Or even three inputs: day of the week/holiday, raininess and temperature. Whatever the inputs, the output is sales of ice cream.\n\n\n\n\nSimplifying loss\nWe have two functions that, together, quantify risk. A loss function \\(L(\\cal O\\) and a probability function \\(p(\\cal O)\\) where \\(\\cal O\\) is the uncertain outcome of the event. It’s very common to compose these two functions into a single function: \\(p(L(\\cal O))\\). Imagine \\(L(\\cal O)\\) has an output denominated in, say, dollars. The composed function then looks like \\(p(\\$)\\). There may be many different outcomes that lead to the same $ loss, but lumping them together as a single $ outcome gives a function \\(p(\\$)\\). Presented this way, risk measurement is reduced to a single function with a single input, $, and an output in the form of a probability.\n\n\nProbability, odds, log odds\nThe scale generally used for uncertainty is “probability,” a number between 0 and 1. But there are other scales in use and sometimes these have advantages for doing calculations. The two most important are:\n\nOdds\nLog odds\n\nAny probability can be converted to an odds and vice versa. Similarly, log odds can be converted into odds by using exponentiation (or vice versa, by using the logarithm function).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdds and gambling\n\n\n\nThe bookie arranges things so that the money staked by the gamblers is simply redistributed. The winners get back their stake plus the money staked by the losers. The odds given reflect the balance between the winners’ stakes and the losers’ stakes. If $50 is bet on A and $25 on B, then the odds on A will be 1:2. That is, the winners, if A is the outcome, will get $25 plus their stake back. Since their stake was $50, the odds will be 1:2. On the other hand, if B is the outcome, the winners will get $50 plus their stake. This corresponds to odds of 2:1.\n\n\n\n\nAccumulating loss\nProvide a situation where there are many “risk factors” for an outcome. Suppose the outcome is disease D and there are risk factors \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), \\(R_3\\), …, say “smoking,” “drinking,” “sun exposure,” “speeding,” and so on. With disease, age is almost always a factor.\nImagine that the risk of D in the next 10 years is p_0 = 20% for a 20-year old who doesn’t smoke, drink, sunbathe, or drive too fast. For the sake of illustration, let’s imagine that smoking triples the risk, drinking doubles it, sunbathing increases it by 50%, speeding doubles it, and each year of age increases it by 2%. The 50-year old who has all the risk factors therefore faces a risk of D of\n$             = 6.52 $\nThis is ridiculous: you can’t have a probability of 6.52. In general, it doesn’t work to multiply the effects of risk factors.\nInstead, the standard statistical/mathematical approach is to represent risk using log odds.\nBase risk: 20% which corresponds to odds of 2/8 or log odds of -1.39.\nSmoking: Triples the risk to 60%, that is odds of 6/4 or log odds of 0.405. This is an increase of \\((0.405 - -1.39) = 1.75\\) above the base risk.\nDrinking: Doubles the risk to 40%, that is odds of 4/6 or log odds of -0.405, an increase above the base rate of \\(-0.405 - -1.39 = 0.985\\).\nTo accumulate risk, rather than multiplying, we add in the log-odds increment due to each risk factor.\nIf multiplying, smoking and drinking for a 20-year old would produce a risk of \\(0.2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 1.2\\), which cannot be a probability.\nAdding the log-odds increments gives the log-odds for a 20-year smoker/drinker as \\(-1.39 + 1.75 + 0.985 = 1.345\\). The odds for this person are therefore \\(e^{1.345} = 3.83\\). Converting odds back to probability gives \\(\\frac{3.83}{1+3.83} = 79\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sigmoidal pattern\n\n\n\nShow the risk as a function of age in the multiplying style: \\(0.2 \\times 1.02^t\\).\nNow show risk as a function of age in log odds format. Base is \\(-1.39\\). One year’s increment gives \\(0.2 \\times 1.02 = 0.204\\) which converts to \\(\\ln(\\frac{.204/.796}) = -1.36\\), an increment of 0.03 in log-odds units.\nIn this format, risk as a function of age will be \\(-1.39 + 0.03t\\), where \\(t\\) is the number of years past age 20. We can convert this to a probability as a function of age:\n\\(p(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-1.39 + 0.03t)}{1 + \\exp(-1.39 + 0.03t)}\\). To emphasize the pattern, let’s follow the person’s risk over the next 200 years (even though nobody lives to age 220).\n\nslice_plot(exp(-1.39+0.03*t)/ (1+exp(-1.39+0.03*t)) ~ t, bounds(t=0:200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Human perception of risk\n\n\n\nPeople tend to perceive risk in a way that doesn’t correspond to a probability or a value scale (such as ice-cream sales). First, outcomes with a high probability are seen as certain. Outcomes with a very low probability are either seen as impossible or rounded up. So the perception of a one-in-a-million risk is seen as a risk on the order of 1% or 10%.\nSecond, there are “dread factors” that can dramatically increase the perceived risk. Examples are: “out of my control,” “impact on the unborn,” “hidden impact.” The dread-factor theory provides an explanation for why many people see commercial aviation as riskier than driving, or the huge aversion to low levels of radiation exposure."

    "text": "Lesson\nShort discussion about the words “hypothesis” and “theory.” Try to establish a simple, concrete definition of hypothesis: “A statement about the world that might or might not be correct.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining “hypothesis”\n\n\n\n\nA supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation: professional astronomers attacked him for popularizing an unconfirmed hypothesis.\nPhilosophy a proposition made as a basis for reasoning, without any assumption of its truth: [with clause] : the hypothesis that every event has a cause.\n\nORIGIN: late 16th century: via late Latin from Greek hupothesis ‘foundation’, from hupo ‘under’ + thesis ‘placing’.\nSource: New Oxford American Dictionary\n\n\nA DAG is merely a hypothesis about how mechanisms function. One of the prime objectives of “science,” be it a natural science like chemistry or a social science like economics, is to provide evidence for an against relevant hypotheses.\nIt’s a common view of science, at least in sciences such as chemistry or physics or molecular genetics, that the theories (say, \\(F = ma\\) or the translation of DNA triples into amino acids) are a complete and truthful description of the world. The word “theory” itself aids in this perception and often one studies “theory” in order to be able to calculate the outcomes in various situations, for instance the speed over time of a rocket accelerating upward as it burns fuel. We don’t talk about the “hypothesis of relativity” or “quantum hypothesis.” The word “hypothesis” suggests doubt. There was certainly substantial doubt in the early days of relativity or quantum mechanics or even Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. But evidence has been adduced to such an extent that the doubt is practically dispelled and what were once hypotheses are now considered theories. (There’s also a pattern of using “theory” to promote hypotheses into being regarded as more substantial. An example is “string theory,” which is not a generally accepted way of describing nature. The “theory of dark matter” is similar.)\n\nEvidence for or against hypotheses\n\nPrediction and observation.\n\nParticularly noteworthy are predictions that go against other hypotheses. For example, Newtonian gravitation isn’t a wave phenomenon, but general relativity (Einstein’s theory of gravity) does predict wave-like behavior. In (Lesson 26)[Math300R-Lesson26.html] we discussed techniques for making predictions that incorporate uncertainty. This provides a means to refine judgements about the extent to which a prediction is supported by observation.\nFor instance, General Relativity supports a prediction that gravity propagates like a wave. This prediction can be quantified: a wave that might be observable by an incredibly delicate apparatus would be generated by, say, a supernova. Apparatus is built, the predicted phenomena is observed, and confidence in the theory increases accordingly. Often, predictions are not followed by observation. This unhappy situation is often followed by attempts to tweak the theory to make improved predictions that correspond to the (lack of) observation.\n\nExperiment, which is closely associated with the “scientific method.”\n\nThe hallmark of experiment is intervention. For instance, an important theory of plant growth involves a chemical called “auxin.” The theory holds that exposing plant tissue to light inhibits the generation of auxin. The auxin in turn, facilitates tissue growth and expansion. The result of the differential growth in on the lit and shaded side of a plant is growth toward the source of light. Illustration.\nMuch of the experimentalist’s intervention involves standardizing the conditions of the experiment. For instance, a plant growth study will provide a standard soil mixture, temperature, and watering amount for all the plants being studied.\nBut experiment always involves another aspect: one or more of the conditions is made to vary from one experimental unit to another. For instance, some plants might be lit from the North and others from the South. Seeing the same pattern of light-associated plant growth from both directions provides evidence that the Earth’s magnetic field is not a factor in determining plant orientation.\n\n\nSimulating experiment with DAGs\nExperiment is hard work and good experimental technique is paramount. Our goal here is to enhance the understanding of how experiment works generally. We’re going to do this by simulation/gaming.\nWe’ll start with a DAG that provides the rules of the game for how different factors are connected. We’ll generate samples from the DAG and do some data analysis to illuminate the conditions in which data analysis can reveal—or not—the DAG mechanism. Then we’ll simulate the intervention of experiment and see whether this can improve our ability to reveal the mechanism. (Of course, in real science, we don’t have this ability to look immediately at the mechanism and see how it’s structured. Our goal, however, is not to do science but to illustrate how scientific technique works.)\nConsider this DAG:\n\ndag08\n\n[[1]]\nc ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\nx ~ c + eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\ndag_draw(dag08)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from the DAG formulas that the value of y increases or decreases exactly with the value of x. (The “coefficient” on x is 1.0)\nAs we’ve done before, we can simulate data from dag08 and use regression to observe the relationship between x and y.\n\nSample <- sample(dag08, size=1000) # big, so that the noise is not a strong issue\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   3.032987    1.526424 \n\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.956402 3.109573\nx           1.471201 1.581648\n\n\nThe coefficient we observe is 1.5, not 1.0. So this approach to data analysis is not revealing the true mechanism. (It’s legitimate to wonder whether 1.5 is really that different from 1.0, given the random factors involved in the mechanism. The confidence interval guides us here. By using size=1000, we narrowed the confidence interval to the extent that the interval on the observed coefficient has no overlap with the DAG specified coefficient of 1.0).\nIn Lesson 27 we discussed using covariates in a model in order to get a more accurate view of the true mechanism. This is a valuable technique, but using it requires that we know what are the covariates and can record their values in data. In this lesson, we’ll imagine that we know how to do an experiment but don’t have any reliable knowledge about covariates.\n\n\nIntervening in a DAG\nCarrying out an experiment means intervening in the workings of the system. The intervention we’re going to make in this example is to experimentally “control” or “set” the values of x.\nIn practice, this means we are creating a new DAG that represents our intervention in the system.\nThe dag_intervene() function is convenient for constructing the new DAG. The function works by letting us create a new formula for any variable in the DAG.

In other words, the experimental intervention correctly reveals the true mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariates eat variance\n\n\n\nIf we have access to covariates, it’s perfectly legitimate to include them in our models as explanatory variables. The advantage of doing so is that the amount of noise in y is reduced, because we are accounting for it by using the covariate.\n\nlm(y ~ x + c, data = Exp_sample) %>% confint()\n\n                2.5 %    97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.9071149 3.0934024\nx           0.9327862 1.1856615\nc           0.8653050 0.9947296\n\n\nThe confidence interval on the x coefficient is smaller: 0.92 to 1.17.\n\n\n\n\nImperfect experiment\nAn imperfect experiment, in the sense we mean here, is an experiment where the intervention attenuates the inputs to the variable of interest, but doesn’t utterly eliminate them. Here’s an example:\n\nexp08b <- dag_intervene(dag08, x ~ c/2 + binom())\ndag_draw(exp08b)\n\n\n\n\nImperfect experiments are the rule in, say, clinical drug trials. For instance, people who are still sick may drop out of the trial or stop taking the assigned medicine.\nLet’s look at the impact of the imperfection in exp08b:\n\nExpb_sample <- sample(exp08b, size=1000)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Expb_sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.478554 2.667539\nx           1.850226 2.069521\n\n\nThe confidence interval on the coefficient on x shows that we have not correctly revealed the mechanism of x -> y of the DAG.\nThere is a technique to improve results in experimental trial. We’ll make yet another DAG, which will be the same as exp08b but where we record the experimenter’s intended setting for the x variable.\n\nexp08c <- dag_make(\n  c ~ eps(),\n  z ~ binom(),\n  x ~ c/2 + z,\n  y ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n)\ndag_draw(exp08c)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what data analysis reveals for this DAG.\n\nExpc_sample <- sample(exp08c, size=1000)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Expc_sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.362493 2.552886\nx           1.936729 2.154625\n\n\nStill a wrong result. The improvement comes when we ignore the actual value of x and look at the relationship between the experimentally perfect z and y:\n\nlm(y ~ z, data = Expc_sample) %>% confint()\n\n                2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.8341226 3.160231\nz           0.7646216 1.223975\n\n\nBack on target! This method is called “intent to treat” because we are looking at how our experimental intentions play out to y."

    "text": "Lesson\nStatisticians are often careful in their use of language about relationships. They will say two variables are “correlated” or “associated” rather than casually using words like “connected” or “related.” There is even a proverb, “Correlation is not causation.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: XKCD’s take on correlation and causation.\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, statistics courses have emphasized disputing any causal interpretation of correlations found in data. The response “Well, maybe,” in the last panel of the cartoon shows a student correctly having assimilated this lesson.\nAnother formulation might be more enlightening for statistics students: “Correlation is the sign in data of causal connections in mechanisms.” If two variables a and b are correlated, then either a causes b (perhaps indirectly), b causes a (also perhaps indirectly), or both a and b are caused by other factors. There’s another possibility as well, most easily seen with a corresponding DAG in hand. It’s important to consider all of these possibilities, rather than jumping to a conclusion of what causes what.\nIn this lesson, we’re going to look at only those correlations that would be supported by out-of-sample testing. Later, we’ll also need to deal with correlations that are an illusion of sampling fluctuation or due to a systematic hunt.\nWe’ll use the term “spurious correlation” to refer to those correlations created by mechanisms other than a causal path between two variables in a DAG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths in DAGS\n\n\n\nExamples and exercises classifying causal and correlating paths in DAGs.\nSelection on a collider or using it as a covariate.\n\ndag_draw(dag09)\n\n\n\nSample <- sample(dag09, size=500)\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n   -0.03040     -0.03492  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c==1))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c == 1))\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n     0.5683      -0.4086  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c==0))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c == 0))\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n    -0.6213      -0.3505  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample) %>% summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.7595 -0.6700  0.0267  0.6396  2.9366 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "Lesson\nEarlier we described two different types of statistical task:\n\nPrediction. Say something about what the outcome will be for a new case.\nRelationship. Describe how two or more variables are inter-related.\n\nIn a prediction task, we use training data to build a model based on data from the system of interest. The model is then used as a function to calculate the output (and its precision). The goal is to minimize out-of-sample prediction error. Including covariates in the model can sometimes improve the precision, but sometimes not.\nIn a relationship task, we also use training data to build a model. But rather than looking at the output from the model directly, we look at the partial derivative of the model function with respect to an input of interest. This quantifies the strength of the relationship between selected input variable and the response variable.\nSince we’re using first order polynomial models (e.g. y ~ a + b + c), there is no technical difficulty finding the partial derivative. It is simply the model coefficient on the variable of interest.\nIn today’s lesson, we’re going to use gaming so that we know exactly what the causal connections are. Remember, it’s just a game! Our objective in playing the game is to learn in what circumstances we can capture the true causal mechanism behind the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sorting out multiple causes\n\n\n\ndag02 simulates a situation where two variables are connected causally to y. Questions: Can a fitted model capture the true relationships? Must we use both variables?\n\ndag02\n\n[[1]]\nx ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\na ~ eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ 3 * x - 1.5 * a + 5 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\nSample <- sample(dag02, size=500)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   4.956510    2.995888 \n\nlm(y ~ a, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           a \n   5.062005   -1.540196 \n\nlm(y ~ a + x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           a           x \n   4.925914   -1.545395    2.998776 \n\n\nConclusion: Ignoring one of the explanatory variables prevents us (of course!) from seeing that variable’s relationship with y. But the other variable’s connection shows up correctly. Using both explanatory variables let’s us capture the correct mechanism behind y.\n\n\nBut things aren’t always as simple as in the previous example. Consider dag08:\n\ndag_draw(dag08)\n\n\n\n\nHere both c and x have a causal relationship with y. They often happen to have a causal relationship with each other. Will this interfere with finding the direct relationships between x and y and between c and y?\n\ndag08\n\n[[1]]\nc ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\nx ~ c + eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\nSample <- sample(dag08, size=500)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   3.039470    1.582127 \n\nlm(y ~ c, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           c \n   3.033517    2.122726 \n\nlm(y ~ c + x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           c           x \n   3.029310    1.047104    1.044198 \n\n\nHere we need to include both c and x in the model to see the correct causal relationships. If we leave out either x or c the other variable will “inherit” some of the causal connection between the left-out variable and the response.\nThis is called confounding. The dictionary has two different definitions of “confound”:\n\nTo surprise or confuse someone.\nTo mix up (something) with something else so that the individual elements become difficult to distinguish.\n\nIt’s the second definition that is relevant to us.\nAs an example of the “mixing up,” look at the coefficients for the model y ~ c. The DAG shows c having an effect size of 1 directly on y. But c also has an effect on y that is mediated by x. If we leave x out of the model, that indirect effect is mixed in with the direct effect.\nThe mixing of the direct and indirect causal routes from c to y is actually correctly captured by the coefficient 2 from the model. It’s important to be aware of this mixing. If you weren’t, you might be confused (confounded in the first definition!) because the results from y ~ c and y ~ c + x appear to conflict with one another."

These are the conclusions we’re working toward:\n\nIn-sample, including covariates in a model always reduces the (in-sample) prediction error. The pattern is stronger the smaller the training data set.\nOut-of-sample, including covariates may or may not reduce prediction error. It depends on whether the covariates are genuinely connected to the response variable.\nIrrelevant covariates make (out-of-sample) prediction worse. This effect is strongest for small training data sets.\n\nRemember, since some of the conclusions depend on what variables are connected to what, we need to demonstrate the phenomena using a system where we know the structure.\nWe’ll come back to this topic, as a basis for ANOVA, when we do hypothesis testing. There we’ll look at the sum of squares, mean square, F and such.\n\n\nToday, we’ll work mostly with in-sample modeling.

    "text": "Lesson\nWe’ve talked about explanatory variables and the response variable. Sometimes, we have one or a few explanatory variables that we care about, but recognize that others may be playing a role in the formation of the outcome. The explanatory variables that we don’t care about are called covariates. A covariate is nothing more than an explanatory variable in which we don’t have a direct interest.\nToday’s lesson is about whether using covariates can change the prediction error, either for better (a smaller prediction error) or for worse (a bigger prediction error).\nTo illustrate, consider dag04 in which multiple variables contribute to an outcome:\n\ndag_draw(dag04)\n\n\n\n\nIt might seem evident that, to predict d, using a, b, and c as explantory variables will produce narrower prediction intervals than using just one or two of the variables. We can confirm this intuition—we’ll do it with out-of-sample RMS error.\n\nTraining <- sample(dag04, size=500)\nmod1 <- lm(d ~ b, data = Training)\nmod2 <- lm(d ~ a + b + c, data = Training)\nTesting <- sample(dag04, size=1000)\nmod_eval(mod1, data = Testing) %>%\n  summarize(rms = sqrt(mean((d - model_output)^2)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    rms\n  <dbl>\n1  1.76\n\nmod_eval(mod2, data = Testing) %>%\n  summarize(rms = sqrt(mean((d - model_output)^2)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    rms\n  <dbl>\n1  1.02\n\n\nUsing the covariates reduces prediction error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating model comparison\n\n\n\nRather than having to go through the same commands over and over again, let’s write a function that will compare the prediction error of different models. compare_rms_error() is currently defined in the _startup.R file.\nHow about in a situation like dag05:\n\ndag_draw(dag05)\n\n\n\n\n\ncompare_rms_error(dag05, n=500, d ~ c, d ~ b, d ~ a, d ~ a + b + c, in_sample=TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.021258 1.432621 1.746049 1.019837\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\ndag_draw(dag06)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn dag06, which are the best explanatory variables for predicting d?\nCan d and b help in predicting a?\n\n\n\nDo these principles hold for in-sample prediction error?\n\ncompare_rms_error(dag05, n=500, d ~ c, d ~ b, d ~ a, d ~ a + b + c, in_sample=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.013721 1.398789 1.719978 1.015279\n\n\n\nLearning Checks\n\n\n28.1\nConsider dag01, which shows a simple causal relationship between two variable.\n\ndag_draw(dag01)\n\n\n\n\nSo far as the size of prediction error is concerned, does it matter whether x is used to predict y or vice versa?

Sometimes, the prediction interval will be much wider than the actual error. People will accuse you of being overly humble, suggesting that your skills are better than you take credit for. Other times, the prediction interval will be too small. Then you will be accused of over-confidence. But both these outcomes are a matter of luck: whether your sample happened to be a good representation of the actual mechanism or not.\nWhen the prediction bands are double-trumpet shaped, you are at risk of such “over-confidence” or “under-confidence.”\n::: {.callout-note icon=false} ## Optional extension\nThis construction of prediction intervals is based on the idea that we measure the input variables exactly, but the output can involve some noise.\nIt can also happen that our measurement of the input quantities involves noise. This goes by the obscure name “error in variables.” dag05 simulates the error-in-noise situation. Note that the estimated function is systematically flatter than the actual function (which you can read from the DAG).\nTo demonstrate this, insert dag04 in place of dag05 in the simulation, and repeat many times."

It turns out not to be very convenient for working in statistics. The reason: We have many variables stored in data frames. We’d like the input to our model functions to be in the form of a data frame. Even better, we’d like the output also to be in that form.\nThe mod_eval() function let’s us do this.\n\nOutput <- mod_eval(Mod, data = Samp)\n\n\nNote that we built the model with g ~ x + y, so the model outputs a g-like thing.\nThe inputs are x and y which are drawn from the data= frame.\nThe output calculated from the model is called model_output.\n\nThis output is often called a prediction, what the model tells us to expect for the response variable when the inputs are given.\n\nPrediction error\nThe prediction made by the model is not perfect. We can calculate the error, that is the difference between model output and the actual output for the given set of inputs.\n\nOutput <- Output %>% \n  mutate(error = y - model_output)\ngf_density(~ error, data = Output)\n\n\n\ngf_point(error ~ x, data = Output)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe errors have a bell-shaped distribution.\nNote that the error is centered on zero; sometimes the model is high and sometimes low. Only occasionally is it right on target.\nI’ve plotted the error versus the actual value. In this case, there seems to be no systematic deviation from being centered on zero.\n\nWe can quantify the average size of the error with the root mean square error:\n\nOutput %>% summarize(rms_error = sqrt(mean(error^2)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  rms_error\n      <dbl>\n1     0.960\n\n\nThis number is intended to be used to quantify the uncertainty in predictions from the model.\nBUT THERE IS A CATCH. Notice that something funny is going on in this pair of commands:\n\nMod <- lm(y ~ x, data = Samp)\nOutput <- mod_eval(Mod, data = Samp)\n\nThe prediction being made here is called an in-sample prediction; the same data are used to construct the model and to calculate the prediction error.\nIn contrast, here is an out-of-sample prediction, where “new” data is used for the data input to mod_eval(). The new data is called testing data, while the data used to construct the model is called training data.\n\nOOS <- mod_eval(Mod, data = sample(dag03, size=10000))\nOOS %>% \n  mutate(error = y - model_output) %>%\n  summarize(rms = sqrt(mean((error^2))))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    rms\n  <dbl>\n1  1.47"

    "text": "Lesson\nIn Lesson 33 we built a classifier based on simulated data from dag10.\n\nA classifier is a function of the variables deemed relevant by the designer and that produces a yes/no output.\nDiscovering a suitable function requires insight and usually trial and error.\n\nHere’s a classifier relevant to dag10:\n\nC1 <- make_classifier(c1 ~ b < 0)\n\nC1 is a function taking a data frame as input. The calculation is whether b is less than 0. If so, the function output is a 1. The output will be added as column c1 to the input data\nTo evaluate it, create a dataframe from dag10 and run the classifier on it.\n\nSample <- sample(dag10, size=1000) %>% C1()\nwith(Sample, table(y, c1))\n\n   c1\ny     -   +\n  0 368 125\n  1 131 376\n\n\nThe false-positive rate is 125/1000, the false-negative rate is 131/1000. The “accuracy” is (368+376)/1000, about 74%.\nWe designed classifier C1() using where the disease state is 1 about half the time, as appropriate for a case-control design.\n\nSample %>% summarize(yesses = mean(y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  yesses\n   <dbl>\n1  0.507\n\n\nNow we want to deploy the classifier in a realistic setting, where the base rate is only, say, 10%. To simulate this, we’ll keep all of the 0s from the simulation, but only 11% of the 1s.\n\nField_results <- sample(dag10, \n                        size=1000, \n                        survive=~ifelse(y==1, unif() < 0.11, TRUE)) %>% C1()\nwith(Field_results, table(y, c1))\n\n   c1\ny     -   +\n  0 683 225\n  1  23  69\n\n\nThe false negative rate is now close to zero: 19/1000. But the false positive rate is 31%, much higher than with the case-control data used to design the classifier.\nWhat’s gone wrong? Why did the false positive rate change?\nThe reason is that the “base rate” (or prevalence) for the disease is 10.1% in dag10b compared to the 50% in dag10. Same classifier, but a different false positive rate.\nWe would like to have a way to characterize a classifier that is independent of the base rate.\nThe false positive rate is a probability: p(0 & +). Similarly, the false negative rate is p(1 & -). We can read these off the table.\nThe quantities of interest to the patient and doctor are different probabilities:\n\np(0 | -) — probability you don’t have the disease given a negative test result\np(1 | +) — probability you have the disease given a positive test result\n\nCalculate these probabilities from the classifer test results for the two base rates we’ve looked at: 50% for dag10 and 21% for dag10b.\n\nCase/control — p(0 | -) is 368/(368 + 131) = 73%\nField – p(0 | -) is 759/(746 + 29) = 96%\nCase/control — p(1 | +) is 376/(376 + 125) = 75%\nField – p(1 | +) is 88/(248+88) = 26%\n\nThese patient-centered probabilities change as the base rate changes. It turns out that the proper way to characterize the classifier is with two different probabilities:\n\nSensitivity: Probability of a + test if you have the disease: p(+ | 1)\nSpecificity: Probability of a - test if you do not have the disease: p(- | 1)\n\nNote that these are not probabilities of direct interest to the patient or doctor. But they do come out the same regardless of the base rate of the disease.\n\nCase/control — p(+ | 1) is 376/(376+131) = 74%\nField – p(+ | 1) is 88/(29+88) = 75%\nCase/control — p(- | 0) is 368/(368 + 125) = 75%\nField – p(- | 0) is 746/(746+248)= 75%\n\nGiven the sensitivity/specificity and the base rate, we can calculate the probability of interest to the patient\np(1 | +) = p(+ | 1) p(1) / (p(+ | 1)p(1) + p(-|0)p(0))\nIn statistics, the sensitivity/specificity is called the “likelihood function”, the probability of the observed data under the actual values in the world. THIS IS WEAK."

    "text": "Lesson\n\nRisk\nIntroduce words related to “risk” and try to convert them into seeing a continuum of “risk” to “opportunity,” that is, uncertain outcomes that could be positive or negative. (“Risk reduction,” “volatility,” “gain,” “gambling”).\nEach risky outcome is quantified by two numbers: a probability, and a value. It’s easiest to talk about the value measured in dollars, but there of course other scales: “lives (lost or saved),” “years of life,” “happiness,” “satisfaction,” etc. Unfortunately, we don’t have standard numerical scales for these.\n(Epidemiologists have a scale for quantifying health outcome: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) which would take a class session on its own to explain, but which is highly instructive.)\nA “loss function” takes as input a possible outcome of an uncertain event and produces as output a value, which we might measure in dollars or QALYs or lives, etc. For the sake of definiteness, denote a loss function as \\(L(\\cal O)\\), where \\(\\cal O\\) is an outcome of the uncertain event. In quantifying loss, each possible outcome \\(\\cal O\\) is associated with a probability. Let’s call this \\(p(\\cal O)\\). Mathematical philosophers have been arguing since the mid 1600s about what exactly is meant by probability. Don’t expect a resolution to this quandry. For our purposes, it suffices to think about a probability of an outcome in the context of a prediction model, using the tools from Lesson 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Ice cream sales\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, imagine the situation of an ice-cream pushcart vendor. If it is cold or rainy, sales will be slight. If it’s beautiful and hot, sales will be high. Help the students construct a plausible “loss” function: sales versus temperature.1 Then generalize that into a function with two inputs, say, raininess and temperature. Or even three inputs: day of the week/holiday, raininess and temperature. Whatever the inputs, the output is sales of ice cream.\n\n\n\n\nSimplifying loss\nWe have two functions that, together, quantify risk. A loss function \\(L(\\cal O\\) and a probability function \\(p(\\cal O)\\) where \\(\\cal O\\) is the uncertain outcome of the event. It’s very common to compose these two functions into a single function: \\(p(L(\\cal O))\\). Imagine \\(L(\\cal O)\\) has an output denominated in, say, dollars. The composed function then looks like \\(p(\\$)\\). There may be many different outcomes that lead to the same $ loss, but lumping them together as a single $ outcome gives a function \\(p(\\$)\\). Presented this way, risk measurement is reduced to a single function with a single input, $, and an output in the form of a probability.\n\n\nProbability, odds, log odds\nThe scale generally used for uncertainty is “probability,” a number between 0 and 1. But there are other scales in use and sometimes these have advantages for doing calculations. The two most important are:\n\nOdds\nLog odds\n\nAny probability can be converted to an odds and vice versa. Similarly, log odds can be converted into odds by using exponentiation (or vice versa, by using the logarithm function).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdds and gambling\n\n\n\nThe bookie arranges things so that the money staked by the gamblers is simply redistributed. The winners get back their stake plus the money staked by the losers. The odds given reflect the balance between the winners’ stakes and the losers’ stakes. If $50 is bet on A and $25 on B, then the odds on A will be 1:2. That is, the winners, if A is the outcome, will get $25 plus their stake back. Since their stake was $50, the odds will be 1:2. On the other hand, if B is the outcome, the winners will get $50 plus their stake. This corresponds to odds of 2:1.\n\n\n\n\nAccumulating loss\nProvide a situation where there are many “risk factors” for an outcome. Suppose the outcome is disease D and there are risk factors \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), \\(R_3\\), …, say “smoking,” “drinking,” “sun exposure,” “speeding,” and so on. With disease, age is almost always a factor.\nImagine that the risk of D in the next 10 years is p_0 = 20% for a 20-year old who doesn’t smoke, drink, sunbathe, or drive too fast. For the sake of illustration, let’s imagine that smoking triples the risk, drinking doubles it, sunbathing increases it by 50%, speeding doubles it, and each year of age increases it by 2%. The 50-year old who has all the risk factors therefore faces a risk of D of\n$             = 6.52 $\nThis is ridiculous: you can’t have a probability of 6.52. In general, it doesn’t work to multiply the effects of risk factors.\nInstead, the standard statistical/mathematical approach is to represent risk using log odds.\nBase risk: 20% which corresponds to odds of 2/8 or log odds of -1.39.\nSmoking: Triples the risk to 60%, that is odds of 6/4 or log odds of 0.405. This is an increase of \\((0.405 - -1.39) = 1.75\\) above the base risk.\nDrinking: Doubles the risk to 40%, that is odds of 4/6 or log odds of -0.405, an increase above the base rate of \\(-0.405 - -1.39 = 0.985\\).\nTo accumulate risk, rather than multiplying, we add in the log-odds increment due to each risk factor.\nIf multiplying, smoking and drinking for a 20-year old would produce a risk of \\(0.2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 1.2\\), which cannot be a probability.\nAdding the log-odds increments gives the log-odds for a 20-year smoker/drinker as \\(-1.39 + 1.75 + 0.985 = 1.345\\). The odds for this person are therefore \\(e^{1.345} = 3.83\\). Converting odds back to probability gives \\(\\frac{3.83}{1+3.83} = 79\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sigmoidal pattern\n\n\n\nShow the risk as a function of age in the multiplying style: \\(0.2 \\times 1.02^t\\).\nNow show risk as a function of age in log odds format. Base is \\(-1.39\\). One year’s increment gives \\(0.2 \\times 1.02 = 0.204\\) which converts to \\(\\ln(\\frac{.204/.796}) = -1.36\\), an increment of 0.03 in log-odds units.\nIn this format, risk as a function of age will be \\(-1.39 + 0.03t\\), where \\(t\\) is the number of years past age 20. We can convert this to a probability as a function of age:\n\\(p(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-1.39 + 0.03t)}{1 + \\exp(-1.39 + 0.03t)}\\). To emphasize the pattern, let’s follow the person’s risk over the next 200 years (even though nobody lives to age 220).\n\nslice_plot(exp(-1.39+0.03*t)/ (1+exp(-1.39+0.03*t)) ~ t, bounds(t=0:200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Human perception of risk\n\n\n\nPeople tend to perceive risk in a way that doesn’t correspond to a probability or a value scale (such as ice-cream sales). First, outcomes with a high probability are seen as certain. Outcomes with a very low probability are either seen as impossible or rounded up. So the perception of a one-in-a-million risk is seen as a risk on the order of 1% or 10%.\nSecond, there are “dread factors” that can dramatically increase the perceived risk. Examples are: “out of my control,” “impact on the unborn,” “hidden impact.” The dread-factor theory provides an explanation for why many people see commercial aviation as riskier than driving, or the huge aversion to low levels of radiation exposure."

One of the prime objectives of “science,” be it a natural science like chemistry or a social science like economics, is to provide evidence for an against relevant hypotheses.\nIt’s a common view of science, at least in sciences such as chemistry or physics or molecular genetics, that the theories (say, \\(F = ma\\) or the translation of DNA triples into amino acids) are a complete and truthful description of the world. The word “theory” itself aids in this perception and often one studies “theory” in order to be able to calculate the outcomes in various situations, for instance the speed over time of a rocket accelerating upward as it burns fuel. We don’t talk about the “hypothesis of relativity” or “quantum hypothesis.” The word “hypothesis” suggests doubt. There was certainly substantial doubt in the early days of relativity or quantum mechanics or even Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. But evidence has been adduced to such an extent that the doubt is practically dispelled and what were once hypotheses are now considered theories. (There’s also a pattern of using “theory” to promote hypotheses into being regarded as more substantial. An example is “string theory,” which is not a generally accepted way of describing nature. The “theory of dark matter” is similar.)\n\nEvidence for or against hypotheses\n\nPrediction and observation.\n\nParticularly noteworthy are predictions that go against other hypotheses. For example, Newtonian gravitation isn’t a wave phenomenon, but general relativity (Einstein’s theory of gravity) does predict wave-like behavior. In (Lesson 26)[Math300R-Lesson26.html] we discussed techniques for making predictions that incorporate uncertainty. This provides a means to refine judgements about the extent to which a prediction is supported by observation.\nFor instance, General Relativity supports a prediction that gravity propagates like a wave. This prediction can be quantified: a wave that might be observable by an incredibly delicate apparatus would be generated by, say, a supernova. Apparatus is built, the predicted phenomena is observed, and confidence in the theory increases accordingly. Often, predictions are not followed by observation. This unhappy situation is often followed by attempts to tweak the theory to make improved predictions that correspond to the (lack of) observation.\n\nExperiment, which is closely associated with the “scientific method.”\n\nThe hallmark of experiment is intervention. For instance, an important theory of plant growth involves a chemical called “auxin.” The theory holds that exposing plant tissue to light inhibits the generation of auxin. The auxin in turn, facilitates tissue growth and expansion. The result of the differential growth in on the lit and shaded side of a plant is growth toward the source of light. Illustration.\nMuch of the experimentalist’s intervention involves standardizing the conditions of the experiment. For instance, a plant growth study will provide a standard soil mixture, temperature, and watering amount for all the plants being studied.\nBut experiment always involves another aspect: one or more of the conditions is made to vary from one experimental unit to another. For instance, some plants might be lit from the North and others from the South. Seeing the same pattern of light-associated plant growth from both directions provides evidence that the Earth’s magnetic field is not a factor in determining plant orientation.\n\n\nSimulating experiment with DAGs\nExperiment is hard work and good experimental technique is paramount. Our goal here is to enhance the understanding of how experiment works generally. We’re going to do this by simulation/gaming.\nWe’ll start with a DAG that provides the rules of the game for how different factors are connected. We’ll generate samples from the DAG and do some data analysis to illuminate the conditions in which data analysis can reveal—or not—the DAG mechanism. Then we’ll simulate the intervention of experiment and see whether this can improve our ability to reveal the mechanism. (Of course, in real science, we don’t have this ability to look immediately at the mechanism and see how it’s structured. Our goal, however, is not to do science but to illustrate how scientific technique works.)\nConsider this DAG:\n\ndag08\n\n[[1]]\nc ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\nx ~ c + eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\ndag_draw(dag08)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from the DAG formulas that the value of y increases or decreases exactly with the value of x. (The “coefficient” on x is 1.0)\nAs we’ve done before, we can simulate data from dag08 and use regression to observe the relationship between x and y.\n\nSample <- sample(dag08, size=1000) # big, so that the noise is not a strong issue\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   2.906423    1.520879 \n\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.829930 2.982917\nx           1.468156 1.573602\n\n\nThe coefficient we observe is 1.5, not 1.0. So this approach to data analysis is not revealing the true mechanism. (It’s legitimate to wonder whether 1.5 is really that different from 1.0, given the random factors involved in the mechanism. The confidence interval guides us here. By using size=1000, we narrowed the confidence interval to the extent that the interval on the observed coefficient has no overlap with the DAG specified coefficient of 1.0).\nIn Lesson 27 we discussed using covariates in a model in order to get a more accurate view of the true mechanism. This is a valuable technique, but using it requires that we know what are the covariates and can record their values in data. In this lesson, we’ll imagine that we know how to do an experiment but don’t have any reliable knowledge about covariates.\n\n\nIntervening in a DAG\nCarrying out an experiment means intervening in the workings of the system. The intervention we’re going to make in this example is to experimentally “control” or “set” the values of x.\nIn practice, this means we are creating a new DAG that represents our intervention in the system.\nThe dag_intervene() function is convenient for constructing the new DAG. The function works by letting us create a new formula for any variable in the DAG. For an ideal experiment, the new formula will just involve setting the values of x as we will.\n\ndag08\n\n[[1]]\nc ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\nx ~ c + eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\nexp08 <- dag_intervene(dag08, x ~ binom())\ndag_draw(exp08)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the experimental intervention has disconnected all the inputs from x.\nSample data from exp08 and do an appropriate data analysis:\n\nExp_sample <- sample(exp08, size=1000)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Exp_sample) %>% confint()\n\n                2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.8774544 3.123241\nx           0.7981715 1.152565\n\n\nThe confidence interval on the coefficient on x is 0.88 to 1.21, completely consistent with the (known) mechanism linking x and y. In other words, the experimental intervention correctly reveals the true mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariates eat variance\n\n\n\nIf we have access to covariates, it’s perfectly legitimate to include them in our models as explanatory variables. The advantage of doing so is that the amount of noise in y is reduced, because we are accounting for it by using the covariate.\n\nlm(y ~ x + c, data = Exp_sample) %>% confint()\n\n                2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.9587005 3.129360\nx           0.8872702 1.133259\nc           0.9474298 1.068057\n\n\nThe confidence interval on the x coefficient is smaller: 0.92 to 1.17.\n\n\n\n\nImperfect experiment\nAn imperfect experiment, in the sense we mean here, is an experiment where the intervention attenuates the inputs to the variable of interest, but doesn’t utterly eliminate them. Here’s an example:\n\nexp08b <- dag_intervene(dag08, x ~ c/2 + binom())\ndag_draw(exp08b)\n\n\n\n\nImperfect experiments are the rule in, say, clinical drug trials. For instance, people who are still sick may drop out of the trial or stop taking the assigned medicine.\nLet’s look at the impact of the imperfection in exp08b:\n\nExpb_sample <- sample(exp08b, size=1000)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Expb_sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.460069 2.653130\nx           1.906437 2.133859\n\n\nThe confidence interval on the coefficient on x shows that we have not correctly revealed the mechanism of x -> y of the DAG.\nThere is a technique to improve results in experimental trial. We’ll make yet another DAG, which will be the same as exp08b but where we record the experimenter’s intended setting for the x variable.\n\nexp08c <- dag_make(\n  c ~ eps(),\n  z ~ binom(),\n  x ~ c/2 + z,\n  y ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n)\ndag_draw(exp08c)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what data analysis reveals for this DAG.\n\nExpc_sample <- sample(exp08c, size=1000)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Expc_sample) %>% confint()\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.430078 2.621672\nx           1.882310 2.099708\n\n\nStill a wrong result. The improvement comes when we ignore the actual value of x and look at the relationship between the experimentally perfect z and y:\n\nlm(y ~ z, data = Expc_sample) %>% confint()\n\n                2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 2.8159131 3.142339\nz           0.8306938 1.293256\n\n\nBack on target! This method is called “intent to treat” because we are looking at how our experimental intentions play out to y."

Sometimes, the prediction interval will be much wider than the actual error. People will accuse you of being overly humble, suggesting that your skills are better than you take credit for. Other times, the prediction interval will be too small. Then you will be accused of over-confidence.

This goes by the obscure name “error in variables.” dag05 simulates the error-in-noise situation. Note that the estimated function is systematically flatter than the actual function (which you can read from the DAG).\nTo demonstrate this, insert dag04 in place of dag05 in the simulation, and repeat many times."

    "text": "Lesson\nEarlier we described two different types of statistical task:\n\nPrediction. Say something about what the outcome will be for a new case.\nRelationship. Describe how two or more variables are inter-related.\n\nIn a prediction task, we use training data to build a model based on data from the system of interest. The model is then used as a function to calculate the output (and its precision). The goal is to minimize out-of-sample prediction error. Including covariates in the model can sometimes improve the precision, but sometimes not.\nIn a relationship task, we also use training data to build a model. But rather than looking at the output from the model directly, we look at the partial derivative of the model function with respect to an input of interest. This quantifies the strength of the relationship between selected input variable and the response variable.\nSince we’re using first order polynomial models (e.g. y ~ a + b + c), there is no technical difficulty finding the partial derivative. It is simply the model coefficient on the variable of interest.\nIn today’s lesson, we’re going to use gaming so that we know exactly what the causal connections are. Remember, it’s just a game! Our objective in playing the game is to learn in what circumstances we can capture the true causal mechanism behind the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sorting out multiple causes\n\n\n\ndag02 simulates a situation where two variables are connected causally to y. Questions: Can a fitted model capture the true relationships? Must we use both variables?\n\ndag02\n\n[[1]]\nx ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\na ~ eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ 3 * x - 1.5 * a + 5 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\nSample <- sample(dag02, size=500)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   5.019408    2.970963 \n\nlm(y ~ a, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           a \n   4.948697   -1.457340 \n\nlm(y ~ a + x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           a           x \n   4.981992   -1.495352    2.989184 \n\n\nConclusion: Ignoring one of the explanatory variables prevents us (of course!) from seeing that variable’s relationship with y. But the other variable’s connection shows up correctly. Using both explanatory variables let’s us capture the correct mechanism behind y.\n\n\nBut things aren’t always as simple as in the previous example. Consider dag08:\n\ndag_draw(dag08)\n\n\n\n\nHere both c and x have a causal relationship with y. They often happen to have a causal relationship with each other. Will this interfere with finding the direct relationships between x and y and between c and y?\n\ndag08\n\n[[1]]\nc ~ eps()\n\n[[2]]\nx ~ c + eps()\n\n[[3]]\ny ~ x + c + 3 + eps()\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"list\"      \"dagsystem\"\n\nSample <- sample(dag08, size=500)\nlm(y ~ x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           x \n   2.936074    1.451784 \n\nlm(y ~ c, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           c \n   2.911537    1.985511 \n\nlm(y ~ c + x, data = Sample) %>% coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)           c           x \n  2.9259344   1.0587414   0.9101988 \n\n\nHere we need to include both c and x in the model to see the correct causal relationships. If we leave out either x or c the other variable will “inherit” some of the causal connection between the left-out variable and the response.\nThis is called confounding. The dictionary has two different definitions of “confound”:\n\nTo surprise or confuse someone.\nTo mix up (something) with something else so that the individual elements become difficult to distinguish.\n\nIt’s the second definition that is relevant to us.\nAs an example of the “mixing up,” look at the coefficients for the model y ~ c. The DAG shows c having an effect size of 1 directly on y. But c also has an effect on y that is mediated by x. If we leave x out of the model, that indirect effect is mixed in with the direct effect.\nThe mixing of the direct and indirect causal routes from c to y is actually correctly captured by the coefficient 2 from the model. It’s important to be aware of this mixing. If you weren’t, you might be confused (confounded in the first definition!) because the results from y ~ c and y ~ c + x appear to conflict with one another."

It turns out not to be very convenient for working in statistics. The reason: We have many variables stored in data frames. We’d like the input to our model functions to be in the form of a data frame. Even better, we’d like the output also to be in that form.\nThe mod_eval() function let’s us do this.\n\nOutput <- mod_eval(Mod, data = Samp)\n\n\nNote that we built the model with g ~ x + y, so the model outputs a g-like thing.\nThe inputs are x and y which are drawn from the data= frame.\nThe output calculated from the model is called model_output.\n\nThis output is often called a prediction, what the model tells us to expect for the response variable when the inputs are given.\n\nPrediction error\nThe prediction made by the model is not perfect. We can calculate the error, that is the difference between model output and the actual output for the given set of inputs.\n\nOutput <- Output %>% \n  mutate(error = y - model_output)\ngf_density(~ error, data = Output)\n\n\n\ngf_point(error ~ x, data = Output)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe errors have a bell-shaped distribution.\nNote that the error is centered on zero; sometimes the model is high and sometimes low. Only occasionally is it right on target.\nI’ve plotted the error versus the actual value. In this case, there seems to be no systematic deviation from being centered on zero.\n\nWe can quantify the average size of the error with the root mean square error:\n\nOutput %>% summarize(rms_error = sqrt(mean(error^2)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  rms_error\n      <dbl>\n1     0.960\n\n\nThis number is intended to be used to quantify the uncertainty in predictions from the model.\nBUT THERE IS A CATCH. Notice that something funny is going on in this pair of commands:\n\nMod <- lm(y ~ x, data = Samp)\nOutput <- mod_eval(Mod, data = Samp)\n\nThe prediction being made here is called an in-sample prediction; the same data are used to construct the model and to calculate the prediction error.\nIn contrast, here is an out-of-sample prediction, where “new” data is used for the data input to mod_eval(). The new data is called testing data, while the data used to construct the model is called training data.\n\nOOS <- mod_eval(Mod, data = sample(dag03, size=10000))\nOOS %>% \n  mutate(error = y - model_output) %>%\n  summarize(rms = sqrt(mean((error^2))))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    rms\n  <dbl>\n1  1.47"

They will say two variables are “correlated” or “associated” rather than casually using words like “connected” or “related.” There is even a proverb, “Correlation is not causation.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: XKCD’s take on correlation and causation.\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, statistics courses have emphasized disputing any causal interpretation of correlations found in data. The response “Well, maybe,” in the last panel of the cartoon shows a student correctly having assimilated this lesson.\nAnother formulation might be more enlightening for statistics students: “Correlation is the sign in data of causal connections in mechanisms.” If two variables a and b are correlated, then either a causes b (perhaps indirectly), b causes a (also perhaps indirectly), or both a and b are caused by other factors. There’s another possibility as well, most easily seen with a corresponding DAG in hand. It’s important to consider all of these possibilities, rather than jumping to a conclusion of what causes what.\nIn this lesson, we’re going to look at only those correlations that would be supported by out-of-sample testing. Later, we’ll also need to deal with correlations that are an illusion of sampling fluctuation or due to a systematic hunt.\nWe’ll use the term “spurious correlation” to refer to those correlations created by mechanisms other than a causal path between two variables in a DAG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths in DAGS\n\n\n\nExamples and exercises classifying causal and correlating paths in DAGs.\nSelection on a collider or using it as a covariate.\n\ndag_draw(dag09)\n\n\n\nSample <- sample(dag09, size=500)\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n   -0.03765     -0.01874  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c==1))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c == 1))\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n     0.6080      -0.4141  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c==0))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample %>% filter(c == 0))\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            b  \n    -0.6491      -0.4410  \n\nlm(a ~ b, data = Sample) %>% summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = a ~ b, data = Sample)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.7564 -0.6780  0.0248  0.6398  3.3231 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

After this is complete, have students do the calculations for the second model and answer those questions.\nThe mosaicData::SaratogaHouses data frame contains information about the sales price and various attributes of about 1700 houses. (See ?SaratogaHouses for a detailed description.)\nDo a regression of price ~ bedrooms and explain what the regression coefficients mean.\n\nlm(price ~ bedrooms, data=SaratogaHouses) |> coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)    bedrooms \n   59862.96    48217.81 \n\n\n\nWhat are the units of the intercept and of the bedrooms coefficient? *Intercept in dollars, bedrooms in dollars per bedroom.\nInterpret what the coefficients indicate about the price of houses and bedrooms. Each additional bedroom adds about $50000 to the value of a house.\nAccording to the model, predict what would be the sales price (at the time the data was collected, 2006) of a house with two bedrooms? \\(59863 + 2\\times 48218\\)\n\nOf course, bedrooms are not the only important thing about a house. Let’s include livingArea along with bedrooms in the model.\n\nlm(price ~ livingArea + bedrooms, data=SaratogaHouses) |> coefficients()\n\n(Intercept)  livingArea    bedrooms \n  36667.895     125.405  -14196.769 \n\n\n\nWhat are the units of the livingArea coefficient? dollars per square foot\nWhat does this model say about the value of adding a bedroom? It seems to reduce the value of the house by about $15,000.\n\nBased on exactly the same data, the two models seem to give contradictory statements about the value of an additional bedroom.\n\nIs one model right and the other wrong? If so, which one is right? (Explain your reasoning.) Both models are mathematically correct. But they need to be interpreted in different ways. Each is telling us something different about the real world.\nCould both models be right? If so, explain why the bedroom coefficients have opposite signs. We will need to develop some additional tools and concepts before we can take on this question.\n\nLearning how to interpret models in terms of what they say about the world is a major theme of this second half of Math 300.\nAnother, more technical question that we will address has to do with the precision of coefficients like 125.40 dollars per square foot. Might it actually be $200/ft2? How about $500/ft2? And how seriously should we take the sales value that we calculate by setting numbers for bedrooms and livingArea into the model?"

Sometimes, we have one or a few explanatory variables that we care about, but recognize that others may be playing a role in the formation of the outcome. The explanatory variables that we don’t care about are called covariates. A covariate is nothing more than an explanatory variable in which we don’t have a direct interest.\nToday’s lesson is about whether using covariates can change the prediction error, either for better (a smaller prediction error) or for worse (a bigger prediction error).\nTo illustrate, consider dag04 in which multiple variables contribute to an outcome:\n\ndag_draw(dag04)\n\n\n\n\nIt might seem evident that, to predict d, using a, b, and c as explantory variables will produce narrower prediction intervals than using just one or two of the variables.

These are the conclusions we’re working toward:\n\nIn-sample, including covariates in a model always reduces the (in-sample) prediction error. The pattern is stronger the smaller the training data set.\nOut-of-sample, including covariates may or may not reduce prediction error. It depends on whether the covariates are genuinely connected to the response variable.\nIrrelevant covariates make (out-of-sample) prediction worse. This effect is strongest for small training data sets.\n\nRemember, since some of the conclusions depend on what variables are connected to what, we need to demonstrate the phenomena using a system where we know the structure.\nWe’ll come back to this topic, as a basis for ANOVA, when we do hypothesis testing. There we’ll look at the sum of squares, mean square, F and such.\n\n\nToday, we’ll work mostly with in-sample modeling. This reflects the case in the real world, where you have a data set but not usually an easy way to collect more data for testing.1\nLet’s work with dag04,dag05, and dag07 to illustrate some points about covariates.\n\ndag_draw(dag04)\n\n\n\ndag_draw(dag05)\n\n\n\ndag_draw(dag07)\n\n\n\n\nStart with dag04, where variables a, b, and c all contribute to the formation of d.\n\ncompare_rms_error(dag04, d ~ c, d~ b + c, d ~ a + b + c, n=50, in_sample = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.680281 1.422157 1.031973\n\n\nPrediction error gets smaller, the more covariates are included.\nThe situation can be different. In dag05, a, b, and c all contribute to d, but not separately. a and b communicate with d only via c.

On the other hand, b and c are connected (although the connection is confounded with a).\nLet’s model d by b and look at the p-value:\n\nSample <- sample(dag07, size=50)\nlm(d ~ b, data=Sample) %>% broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   0.0556    0.132      0.422   0.675\n2 b            -0.121     0.0985    -1.23    0.225\n\n\nThe p-value on the b coefficient is large, greater than the usual threshold of 0.05.\nOn the other hand, b and c are connected and the p-value (with this much data) is tiny.\n\nlm(c ~ b, data = Sample) %>% broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   -0.106     0.151    -0.705 4.84e- 1\n2 b             -1.55      0.113   -13.8   2.52e-18\n\n\nImagine a setting where a popular (but unproven!) hypothesis has emerged: that b and d are really related. 100 different research teams rush in to be the first to demonstrate, each generating their own experimental data. We’ll simulate this and collect the summary of the b coefficient w.r.t. d. [First show the statement without the do() to show what each row looks like. Then run the 100 trials and look for small p-values]\n\nAll_groups <- do(100) * {\n  lm(d ~ b, data=sample(dag07, size=50)) %>% \n  broom::tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == 'b')\n  }\n\nDid any of the groups get a “significant” result?\n\nAll_groups %>% \n  filter(p.value < 0.05)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n  term  estimate std.error statistic p.value  .row .index\n  <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl> <int>  <dbl>\n1 b        0.298    0.105       2.84 0.00651     1     42\n2 b       -0.199    0.0889     -2.24 0.0297      1     76\n3 b        0.232    0.0934      2.48 0.0166      1     78\n4 b       -0.211    0.0989     -2.14 0.0375      1     99\n\n\nIn the context of 100 trials being done, it’s understandable that some of the groups happened to get a p-value < 0.05. But suppose that only the groups with small p-values publish their results? Then it looks as if they found a “significant” result.\nHow can we guard against this accidental generation of significant results? The standard answer in scientific work is to replicate the result: the labs should try again to confirm the result they got in the first study. (In practice, there are strong social/financial/career pressures against conducting such replications. These need to be overcome to guard against false discovery.)\nHere’s a simulation where each lab group runs the study twice.

With power comes responsibility. This chapter is about how spurious patterns can arise in data and processes you can use to help ensure that the patterns your models identify are genuine.\nIt’s well known that people are particularly adept at finding patterns. To see this, spend a minute or two with Figure 1, which shows x-y pairs generated by a complex mathematical procedure called the Mersenne-Twister algorithm. How many of the structures created by Mersenne-Twister algorithm can you identify by eye? Take five of the stronger-looking patterns: clusters of points, large empty areas, strings of dots, etc. Write down a list of the patterns you spotted, including the coordinate location of each, a short description (e.g. “arc of dots”), and your subjective sense of how strong or convincing that pattern is.\nWith your list in hand, look at Figure 2 at the end of this section, which displays another n = 1000 x-y pairs generated by the same mathematical procedure. You’re going to check which of the patterns you found in the testing data are confirmed by the training data. Go through your list, looking at each location where you found a pattern in the training data and checking whether a similar pattern appears at that location in the testing data.\nWere any of the patterns you saw in the training data confirmed by the testing data?\nThere’s no denying that the patterns you saw were in the data. But the Mersenne-Twister algorithm is specifically designed not to produce regular patterns. Any that you saw were accidental alignments in the particular sample of data from the algorithm.\nThe “patterns” abstractly referred to in the previous paragraphs appear in data. In data used for modeling, a pattern might be a relationship or correlation between two or more variables, or a cluster of rows in a data frame that have similar values for a response variable and explanatory variables.\nTraining models on data can encode the underlying patterns. For instance, a pattern in the data might result in a model generating detailed predictions or demonstrating a strong effect size of one variable on another.\nA valid pattern is one that steadily appears from one sample of data to another (so long as the sample is big enough). Such consistency suggests that the pattern reflects some genuine aspect of the system generating the data. A false or accidental pattern is one that appears in a sample of data, but is unlikely to show up in another sample. This inconsistency indicates that conclusions based on this pattern are unlikely to be applicable in the future or in new situations.\nThe obvious, direct way to check the validity of a pattern encoded by a model is to see if the same pattern occurs in new data, data that was not used in building the initial model. Lesson 22 took this approach by constructing a sampling distribution of a statistic such as an effect size. To create a sampling distribution, we train many models on different subsets of a data set.\nWhen working with prediction models, the sign of a valid pattern is that the quality of the predictions – perhaps measured with a root-mean-square-error or a sensitivity/specificity – remains consistent when we calculate it on new data. A prediction that shows very small error on the data used to train the model but large error on new data is not a prediction that we can rely on in new settings.\nThe historical rapid growth in data analysis activity and the construction of data sets with large numbers of explanatory variables has made it easier to capture with models both valid patterns and false patterns. This makes it important to recognize that the false detection of patterns is possible whenever you train a model, to be aware of the characteristics of models and data that make false detection more likely, and to adopt procedures to mitigate the risk that the results of your work may not generalize beyond the particular sample of data you have in hand."

    "text": "Example: Falsely discovering purchasing habits\nYou are a data scientist for an internet retailer, Potomac.com, which has just bought a national grocery chain, Austin Foods. You’re part of the team that is connecting the customer loyalty card data from Austin Foods with Potomac’s own large record of purchases. This is accomplished by offering a 10% Xdiscount for an item on Potomac to people who enter their Austin loyalty card number.\nPotomac’s management wants to create a cross-marketing program in which a customer shopping at Potomac will be offered coupons for Austin products. The hope is that the coupon discount will attract new customers to start shopping at Austin’s. In order for this to work, it’s best if the coupons are for products that the customer finds attractive.\nYour job is to build the coupon assignment system, that is, to figure out how to choose which products a customer is most likely to find attractive. To do this, you’ll create a set of classifiers that indicates the interest of a Potomac customer in an Austin product.\nYou’ve got data on 10,000 Potomac/Austin customers, that is, people whose records from Potomac and from Austin you can bring together. There are ten popular Austin products for which coupons can be offered. Among the 10,000 customers, about 16% have actually bought any given Austin product. You have built ten classifiers, one for each of the ten products. The input to the classifiers is 100 standard measures of a customer’s Potomac activity. The output of each classifier is the probability that the customer actually bought the corresponding Austin product.\nThe no-input classifier gives a probability of about 16% that the customer will buy the product. Management hopes that you will be able to segment the market to identify the products that a given person is much more likely to buy.\nIt’s a lot to ask of a person to sort through 100 potential explanatory variables to identify those that are predictive of buying a product. But it’s straightforward to use a model family that can learn on its own which variables are informative. You train the ten classifiers using a tree family of models.\n\nHeads up! The “data” has been created using random numbers, so that there are no actual relationships between the explanatory variables and the purchase outcomes. That is, no actual relationships aside from the accidental ones, such as the patterns encountered in Figure 1.\n\nTo illustrate how the coupon assignment system works, Table @ref(tab:some-results) shows an intermediate step in the calculation, where a probability for each of the ten products is calculated for each customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable @ref(tab:some-results) shows the output of the classifiers for just the first fifteen customers out of the 10,000 used to build the coupon selection system. For each person, all ten classifiers have been applied to estimate the probability that the person would buy each of the ten products. Highlighted in green are those products with a purchase probability greater than 40%.\nThe final output of the coupon assignment system is, for each customer, the identification of the specific products for which the probability is large. Reading Table @ref(tab:some-results), you’ll see that for person 1, product 9 merits a coupon. For person 2, products 2 and 10 merit a coupon. A winning product has not been identified for every customer, but you can’t please everyone.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'formattable'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:scales':\n\n    comma, percent, scientific\n\n\n\n\n(ref:some-results-cap)\n \n\n\nCustomer ID\n\n  \n    product \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n    9 \n    10 \n    11 \n    12 \n    13 \n    14 \n    15 \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    9 \n    13 \n    10 \n    13 \n    5 \n    13 \n    8 \n    7 \n    13 \n    5 \n    44 \n    15 \n    8 \n    13 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    16 \n    14 \n    7 \n    13 \n    11 \n    16 \n    13 \n    10 \n    11 \n    71 \n    8 \n    14 \n    73 \n    0 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    89 \n    13 \n    10 \n    13 \n    11 \n    12 \n    100 \n    12 \n    10 \n    11 \n    10 \n    8 \n    14 \n    0 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    9 \n    13 \n    22 \n    10 \n    14 \n    10 \n    3 \n    6 \n    12 \n    12 \n    12 \n    11 \n    14 \n    10 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    14 \n    3 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    8 \n    11 \n    11 \n    15 \n    10 \n    11 \n    11 \n    14 \n    0 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    16 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    64 \n    9 \n    25 \n    10 \n    8 \n    7 \n    5 \n    11 \n    11 \n    15 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    10 \n    5 \n    9 \n    69 \n    13 \n    20 \n    13 \n    8 \n    8 \n    13 \n    73 \n    20 \n    6 \n    10 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    14 \n    12 \n    15 \n    5 \n    4 \n    14 \n    13 \n    12 \n    4 \n    10 \n    14 \n    21 \n    14 \n    14 \n    13 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n    62 \n    12 \n    12 \n    80 \n    9 \n    0 \n    9 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    9 \n    13 \n    6 \n    10 \n    12 \n    6 \n    17 \n    16 \n    6 \n    6 \n    25 \n    9 \n    5 \n    15 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:some-results-cap) The output of the ten classifiers for the first 15 customers.

But for the combinations with no coupon, the purchase rate was only 11%.\nThe results are impressive. For about half of the customers, the coupon assignment system has identified customers/product combinations with a purchase probability of more than 40%. Often, the probability of purchase is considerably higher than 40%. Targeting each customer with a coupon for the right product is likely to generate a lot of new sales!\n\nSince data was generated using random numbers, we know that the “success” of the coupon assignment system is illusory. Later, we’ll see how the process was able to uncover so many accidental patterns from random data and list some things to look out for when modeling. But first, let’s provide a reliable method for you to identify when your results are based in accidental patterns: using testing data.\n\nA true measure of the performance of a model should be based not on the data on which the model was trained, but data which have been held back for use in testing and not used in training. For this example, we’ll use testing data consisting of 10,000 customers for whom we have the same 100 explanatory variables from the Potomac database and for whom we know if each customer purchased any of the ten products from Austin Foods. Only about 1 in 6 customers bought any single product from Austin. We want to see if the classifier assigns a high probability to those customers who did buy the product. If so, it means we can use just the 100 explanatory variables to find winning products for customers for whom we have no Austin purchasing data.\n\n\nWarning: `as.tibble()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Please use `as_tibble()` instead.\nℹ The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.\n\n\nWarning: The `x` argument of `as_tibble.matrix()` must have unique column names if\n`.name_repair` is omitted as of tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Using compatibility `.name_repair`.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the tibble package.\n  Please report the issue at <\u001b]8;;https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues\u0007https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues\u001b]8;;\u0007>.\n\n\n\n\n(ref:purchase-test-cap)\n \n\n\nCustomer ID\n\n  \n    product \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n    8 \n    9 \n    10 \n    11 \n    12 \n    13 \n    14 \n    15 \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    13 \n    7 \n    13 \n    17 \n    12 \n    8 \n    58 \n    13 \n    7 \n    7 \n    13 \n    9 \n    9 \n    13 \n    6 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    8 \n    19 \n    86 \n    13 \n    13 \n    9 \n    13 \n    18 \n    9 \n    75 \n    16 \n    13 \n    8 \n    13 \n    71 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    25 \n    12 \n    16 \n    0 \n    8 \n    10 \n    16 \n    10 \n    71 \n    8 \n    7 \n    80 \n    10 \n    10 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    15 \n    13 \n    12 \n    11 \n    10 \n    9 \n    17 \n    14 \n    8 \n    3 \n    17 \n    14 \n    12 \n    11 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    8 \n    10 \n    10 \n    38 \n    9 \n    13 \n    11 \n    10 \n    7 \n    11 \n    11 \n    9 \n    7 \n    14 \n    7 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    9 \n    10 \n    8 \n    60 \n    6 \n    4 \n    89 \n    9 \n    7 \n    11 \n    8 \n    10 \n    12 \n    8 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    9 \n    15 \n    6 \n    20 \n    8 \n    100 \n    5 \n    10 \n    10 \n    9 \n    9 \n    13 \n    72 \n    8 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    21 \n    12 \n    14 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    3 \n    11 \n    14 \n    13 \n    13 \n    14 \n    12 \n    12 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    12 \n    9 \n    8 \n    9 \n    21 \n    6 \n    9 \n    71 \n    8 \n    8 \n    9 \n    8 \n    10 \n    9 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    12 \n    16 \n    14 \n    6 \n    10 \n    12 \n    15 \n    10 \n    9 \n    17 \n    19 \n    7 \n    12 \n    9 \n    8 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:purchase-test-cap) Similar to Table @ref(tab:some-results) but for the testing data.\n\n\n\nA valid evaluation of the performance of the system involves using the testing data rather than the training data. Figure @ref(fig:purchase-test) shows the assignment of coupons for the customers in the test data. Although coupons are assigned to these customers, the purchase rate for these items is only 16%, no different than the probability of purchase for no-coupon items. In other words, the coupon assignment system doesn’t work at all!"

    "section": "Sources of false discovery",
    "text": "Sources of false discovery\nHow did the coupon classifier system identify so many accidental patterns, patterns that existed in the training data but not in the testing data?\nOne source of false discovery stems from having multiple potential response variables. In the Potomac/Austin example, there were ten different classifiers at work, one for each of the ten Austin products. Even if the probability of finding an accidental pattern in one classifier is small, looking in ten different places dramatically increases the odds of finding something.\nSimilarly, having a large number of explanatory variables – we had 100 in the coupon classifier – provides many opportunities for false discovery. The probability of an accidental pattern between one outcome and one explanatory variable is small, but with many explanatory variables each being considered it’s much more likely to find something.\nA third source of false discovery at work in the coupon classifier relates to the family of models selected to implement the classifier. We used a tree model classifier capable of searching through the (many) explanatory variables to find ones that are associated with the response outcome. Unbridled, the tree model is capable of very fine stratification. Each coupon classifiers stratified the customers into about 200 levels. On average, then, there were about 50 customers in each strata. But there is variation, so many of the strata are much smaller, with ten or fewer customers. The small groups were constructed by the tree-building algorithm to have similar outcomes among the members, so it’s not surprising to see a very strong pattern in each group. For each classifier, about 15% of all customers fall into a strata with 20 or fewer customers.\nTo illustrate, Figure 3 shows the shape of the tree model for a typical coupon classifier. Each of the splits reflects an accidental alignment of the response variable with one of the explanatory variables. As more splits are made, the group of customers contained in the split becomes smaller. Many of the leaves on the tree contain just a handful of customers who accidentally had similar values for the several explanatory variables used in the splits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A sketch of one of the classifiers constructed for the coupon selection system. The tree-growing algorithm was allowed to keep going until the customer data was split up into very small strata.\n\n\n\n\nThe tree is too complex to be plausible as a real-world mechanism. None of the details in Figure 3 have any validity beyond the training data itself."

    "text": "Identifying false discovery\nWe use data to build statistical models and systems such as the coupon-assignment machine. False discovery occurs when a pattern or model performance seen with one set of data does not generalize to other potential data sets.\nThe basic technique to avoid false discovery is called cross validation. One simple approach to cross validation splits the data frame into two randomly selected non-overlapping sets of rows: one for training and the other for testing. Use the training data to build the system. Use the testing data to evaluate the system’s performance.\nMost often, cross validation is used to test model prediction performance such as the root-mean-square error or the sensitivity and specificity of a classifier. This can be accomplished by taking the trained model and providing as input the explanatory variables from the testing data, then comparing the model output to the actual response variable values in the testing data. Note that using testing data in this way does not involve retraining the model on the testing data.\nHow big should the training set be compared to the testing set? For now, we’ll keep things simple and encourage use of a 50:50 split or something very close to that.\nThis is a simple and reliable approach that should always be used."

    "section": "False discovery and multiple testing",
    "text": "False discovery and multiple testing\nWhen the main interest is in an effect size, standard procedure calls for calculating a confidence interval on the effect. For example, a 2008 study examined the possible relationship between a woman’s diet before conception and the sex of the conceived child. The popular press was particularly taken by this result from the study:\n\nWomen producing male infants consumed more breakfast cereal than those with female infants. The odds ratio for a male infant was 1.87 (95% CI 1.31, 2.65) for women who consumed at least one bowl of breakfast cereal daily compared with those who ate less than or equal to one bowlful per week. [@fetal-sex-2008]\n\nThe model here is a classifier of the sex of the baby based on the amount of breakfast cereal eaten. The effect size tells the change in the odds of a male when the explanatory variable changes from one bowlful of cereal per week to one bowl per day (or more). This effect size is sensibly reported as a ratio of the two odds. A ratio bigger than one means that boys are more likely outcomes for the one-bowl-a-day potential mother than the one-bowl-a-week potential mother. The 95% confidence interval is given as 1.31 to 2.65. This confidence interval does not contain 1. In a conventional interpretation, this provides compelling evidence that the relationship between cereal consumption and sex is not a false pattern.\nBut the confidence interval is not the complete story. The authors are clear in stating their methodology: “Data of the 133 food items from our food frequency questionnaire were analysed, and we also performed additional analyses using broader food groups.” In other words, the authors had available more than 133 potential explanatory variables. For each of these explanatory variables, the study’s authors constructed a confidence interval on the odds ratio. Most of the confidence intervals included 1, providing no compelling evidence of a relationship between that food item and the sex of the conceived child. As it happens, breakfast cereal produced the confidence interval that was the most distant from an odds ratio of 1.\nLet’s look at the range of confidence intervals that can be found from studying 100 potential random variables that are each unrelated to the response variable. We’ll simulate a response randomly generated “sex” G and B where the odds of G is 1. Similarly, each explanatory variable will be a randomly generated “consumption” high or low where the odds of high is 1. A simple stratification of sex by consumption will generate the odds of G for those cases with consumption Y and also the odds of G for those cases with consumption N. Taking the ratio of these odds gives, naturally enough, the odds ratio. We can also calculate from the stratified data a 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio.\nSo that the results will be somewhat comparable to the results in @fetal-sex-2008, we’ll use a similar sample size, that is, n = 740. Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1) shows one trial of the simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:sex-consumption-1-cap)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n\n\nlow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n165\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n211\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:sex-consumption-1-cap) A stratification of sex outcome (B or G) on consumption (high or low) for one trial of the simulation described in the text.\nReferring to Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1), you can see that the odds of G when consumption is low is 182 / 182 = 1. The odds of G when consumption is high is 211/165 = 1.28. The 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio can be calculated. It is 0.95 to 1.73. Since that includes 1, the data underlying Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1) provide little or no evidence for a relationship between sex and consumption. This is exactly what we expect, since the simulation involves entirely random data.\nFigure 4 shows the 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio for 133 trials like that in Table @ref(tab:sex-consumption-1). The confidence interval from each trial is shown as a horizontal line. The large majority of them include 1. That’s to be expected because the data have been generated so that sex and consumption have no relationship except those arising by chance.\n\n\nWarning: geom_vline(): Ignoring `mapping` because `xintercept` was provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Confidence intervals on the odds ratio comparing female and male birth rates for many trials of simulated data with no genuine relationship between the explanatory and response variables.\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, out of 133 simulations there are six where the confidence interval does not include 1. These are shown in red. By necessity, one of the intervals will be the most extreme. If instead of numbering the simulations, we had labelled them with food items – e.g. grapefruit, breakfast cereal, toast – we would have a situation very similar to what seems to have happened in the sex-vs-food study. (For a more detailed analysis of the impact of multiple testing in @fetal-sex-2008, see @young-2009.)\nSuppose now that half of the data used in @fetal-sex-2008 had been held back as testing data. Using the training data, it would be an entirely legitimate practice to generate hypotheses about which specific food items might be related to the sex of the baby. The validity of any one selected hypothesis could then be established using the testing data without the ambiguity introduced by multiple testing. The testing data confidence interval can be taken at face value; the training data confidence interval cannot."

    "text": "Example: Organic discovery?\nIt’s easy to find organic foods in many large grocery stores. Advocates of an organic diet are attracted by a view that it is sustainable, promotes small farms, and helps avoid contact with pesticides. There are also nay-sayers who make valid points, but that is not our purpose here. Informally, I find that many people and news reports point to the health benefits of an organic diet. Usually they believe that these benefits are an established fact.\nA 2018 New York Times article observed:\n\nPeople who buy organic food are usually convinced it’s better for their health, and they’re willing to pay dearly for it. But until now, evidence of the benefits of eating organic has been lacking. [@NYT-2018-10-23-Rabin]\n\nThe new evidence of health benefits is reported in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine [@baudry-2018]\nDescribing the findings of the research, the Times article continued:\n\nEven after these adjustments [for covariates], the most frequent consumers of organic food had 76 percent fewer lymphomas, with 86 percent fewer non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and a 34 percent reduction in breast cancers that develop after menopause.\n\nThe study warrants being taken seriously: it involved about 70,000 French adults among whom 1340 cancers were noted. The summary of organic foot consumption was a scale from 0 to 32 and included 16 labeled products including dairy, meat and fish, eggs, coffee and tea, wine, vegetable oils, and sweets such as chocolate. Adjustment was made for a substantial number of covariates: age, sex, educational level, marital status, income, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, family history of cancer, body mass index, hormonal treatment for menopause, and others.\nYet … the reseach displays many of the features that can lead to false discovery. For instance, results were reported for four different types of cancer: breast, prostate, skin, lymphomas. The study reports p-values and hazard ratios1 comparing cancer rates among the four quartiles of the organic consumption index.\nComparing the most organic (average organic index 19.36/32) and the least organic (average index 0.72/32) groups the 95% confidence interval on the relative risk and p-values given in the study’s Table 4 are:\n\nBreast cancer: 0.66 - 1.16 (p = 0.38)\nProstate cancer: 0.61- 1.73 (p = 0.39)\nSkin cancer: 0.49 - 1.28 (p = 0.11)\nLymphomas: 0.07 - 0.69 (p = 0.05)\n\nYou might be surprised to see that the confidence interval on the relative risk for breast cancer includes 1.0, which suggests no evidence for an effect. As clearly stated in the report, the risk reduction for breast cancer is seen only in a subgroup of study participants: those who are postmenopausal. And even then, the confidence intervals continue to include 1.0:\n\nBreast cancer pre-menopausal: 0.67 - 1.52 (p = 0.85)\nBreast cancer post-menopausal: 0.53 - 1.18 (p = 0.18)\n\nSo where is the claimed 34% reduction in breast cancer cited in the New York Times article. It turns out the the study used two different indices of organic food consumption. The 0 to 32 scale which includes many items for which the amount consumed is very small (e.g., coffee, chocolate) and a “simplified, plant derived organic food score.” It’s only when you look at the full 0 to 32 scale that you see the reduction in post-menopausal breast cancer: the confidence interval is 0.45 to 0.96 (p = 0.03).\nWhat about cancer rates overall? For the 0 to 32 scale the risk ratio was 0.58 - 1.01 (p = 0.10). To see the claimed reduction clearly you need to look at the simplified food score which gives 0.63 - 0.89 (p < 0.005). And it’s only in comparing the highest-index quarter of participants with the lowerest quarter participants that any difference at all is seen in any type of cancer: the middle-half of participants show no difference in relative risk from the lowest-organic quarter of participants. (Because of this, had the study compared the highest quarter to the next highest quarter, they would have seen basically the same relative risks reported in the highest-to-lowest quarter comparison. Then the conclusion would have had a different flavor, perhaps to be reported as “Typical organic food consumption levels show no cancer benefits.”)\nA further source of potential false discovery stems from the study’s starting and stop times. It’s not clear that these were pre-defined; the reported results are intermediate to a longer follow up. The choice to report intermediate results is another way that the number of opportunities for false discovery is increased. And the choice is important: for the follow-up time used, about 2% of the participants developed cancer. In an earlier study of more than 600,000 middle-aged UK women (average age 59), the incidence of cancer was four times larger: 8.6%. [@bradbury-2014] That study did not find any relationship between organic food consumption and overall cancer rates, and found no relationship for 15 out of 16 different types of cancer. The exception is extremely interesting: non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which a similar result was found in the French study.\nSo is the study reported in the New York Times a matter of false discovery? It’s emotionally unsatisfying to discount a result about organic food and non-Hodgkin lymphoma simply because it’s part of a larger study that looked at many different combinations of cancer types and organic food indices. What if the researchers had only studied non-Hodgkin lymphoma – they would have gotten the same result and it wouldn’t have the deficiencies of being the strongest result of many possibilities. It would have stood on its own. But it doesn’t and we are left in a state of doubt."

    "text": "p-values and “significance”\nFalse discovery is not a new problem. The traditional logic can be traced back to 1710, when John Arbuthnot was examining London birth records from 1629 to 1710. Arbuthnot was surprised to find that for each year males were more common than females. In interpreting this finding, Arbuthnot refered to the conventional wisdom that births of males and females are equally likely. If this were the case, in any one year there might, by chance, be more females than males or the other way around. While it’s theoretically possible that chance might produce the string of 82 years with more males, it’s very unlikely. “From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs,” Arburthnot wrote. In more modern language, Arburthnot concluded that the hypothesis of equal rates of male and female births was not consistent with the data. Arbuthnot’s “Chance” corresponds to false discovery, while “Art” is a valid discovery.\nArburthnot’s logic became a standard component of statistical method.\n\nSummarize the data into a single number called a “test statistic”. For Arburthnot the test statistic was the number of years where male births predominated, out of the 82 years being examined. The observed value of the test statistic was 82.\nState a “null hypothesis”, typically something that is the conventional wisdom. For Arburthnot, the null hypothesis was that male and female births are equally likely.\nCalculate a hypothetical quantity based on the null hypothesis: the probability that the test statistic produced in a world in which the null hypothesis holds true would be at least as large as the test statistic.\nIf the probability in (3) is small, one is entitled to “reject the null hypothesis.” Typically, “small” is defined as 0.05 or less.\n\nIn the 1890s, statistical pioneer Karl Pearson invented a test statistic he called \\(\\chi^2\\) (“chi”-squared, with “chi” pronounced “ki” as in “kite”) that can be applied in a variety of settings. In 1900, Pearson published a table [@pearson-1900] that makes it an easy matter to look up the probability in step (3) above. He called this theoretical probability “P”, a name that has stuck but is conventionally written as lower-case “p”.\nData scientists tend to work with “big data”, but for many applications of statistics, data is so scarce that use of separate training and testing data is impractical. For such small data, the calculation of a p-value can be a sensible guard against false discovery. Still, a p-value does not address any of the sources of false discovery outlined in the previous sections of this chapter. When used with small data and simple modeling methods, those sources of false discovery are not so much of a problem. In small data there won’t be multiple explanatory variables that can be searched and there won’t be a choice of response variables. This doesn’t eliminate all problems, since in small data results can depend critically on the inclusion or exclusion of a single row of data. The name “p hacking” has been given to the various ways that researchers can manipulate p-values to get them below 0.05.\nAnother problem with p-values stems from misinterpretation of the admittedly difficult logic that underlies them. The misinterpretations are encouraged by the use of the term “tests of significance” to the p-value method. Particularly galling is the use of the description “statistically significant” to describe a result where p < 0.05. The everyday meaning of “significant” as something of importance is in no way justified by p < 0.05. Instead, the practical importance or not is more clearly signaled by examining an effect size. (It’s extremely disappointing that journalists, who are writing for an audience that for the most part has no understanding of p-value methodology, use “significant” when reporting on the statistics of research findings. It would be more honest to use a neutral term such as “null-validated” or “p-validated” which does not confuse the statistical result with actual practical importance.)\nThe p-value methodology has little or nothing to contribute to data science practice. When data is big there is a much more straightforward method to guard against false discovery: cross validation. And when data is big there is another, more fundamental problem with p-values. They are calculated with reference to a specific null hypothesis of “no effect” or “no relationship.” More realistically, they should be calculated with respect to a hypothesis of “trivial (but potentially non-zero) effect”. There are all sorts of mechanisms in the world (such as common causes) that can create the appearance of some effect or relationship. No matter how trivial in size this is, with sufficient data the p-value will become small. To illustrate, Figure 5 shows the p-value as a function of the sample size n in a system with an R-squared of 0.001, which in most settings would be of no practical signficance.\n\n\nWarning: geom_hline(): Ignoring `mapping` because `yintercept` was provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The p-value as a function of sample size n when the test statistic R-squared has the trivial value 0.001. The horizontal line shows the usual threshold for “significance” of p < 0.05."

    "text": "We all face many yes/no situations. A patient has a disease or does not. A credit card transaction is genuine or fraudulent. A classifier is a statistical model designed to predict the unknown outcome of a yes/no situation from information that is already available.\nConsider a credit-card company might building a classifier to predict at the time of the transaction whether a purchase of gasoline is fraudulent. The company knows how often and how much gasoline the individual cardholders buys, where the cardholder lives, whether the cardholder travels extensively, typical times of day for a purchase, and so on. Feature engineering is the process of using existing data—including, in our example, whether the purchase turned out to be fraudulent—to develop potential markers or signals of the outcome. For simplicity, imagine the features selected are the number of days since the last gasoline purchase and the distance from the last place of purchase.\nOnce potential features have been proposed, the engineers building the classifier assemble training and testing data sets. Suppose, for the purpose of illustration, that the training data has 2000 fraudulent transactions and 4000 non-fraudulent ones, and the testing set is about the same.\nThe word “assemble” was used intentionally to describe how the testing and training data were collected: a case-control study. Since the objective is to detect fraud, it is reasonable to have a lot of “yes” cases in the data. The “no” cases serve as a kind of control; they were included specifically to have balance in the data. If data had been collected as a simple random sample of credit card transactions, there would have been many, many more “no” cases than “yes.”\nWith such training data it is easy to build a statistical model with Fraud as the response variable. That model can then be evaluated on the testing data to produce a model output for each row:\nIt’s understandable that a classifier may not have perfect performance. After all, it iss trying to make a prediction based on limited data, and randomness may play a role.\nThere are different ways of making a mistake, and these different ways have very different consequences. One kind of mistake, called a “false positive”, involves a classifier output that’s positive (i.e. the classifier indicates fraud) but which is wrong. The consequence of this sort of mistake in the present example is a customer who has to find another way to pay for gasoline.\nThe other kind of mistake is called a “false negative”. Here, the classifer output is that the transaction is not fraudulent, but in actuality it was. The consequence of this kind of mistake is different: a successful theft.\nThe nomenclature signals that a mistake has been made with the word “false.” The kind of mistake is either “positive” or “negative”, corresponding to the output of the classifier.\nWhen the classifier gets things right, that is a “true” result. As with the false results, a true result is possible both for a “positive” and a “negative” classifier output. So the two ways of getting things right are called “true positive” and “true negative”.\nTabulating all 6000 rows of the testing data might produce something like this:"

How accurate is such screening? Almost certainly, the accuracy is not as good as an extremely simple, no-input, alternative process: automatically identify every passenger as “not a security problem.” We can estimate the accuracy of the “not a security problem” classifier by guessing what fraction of airplane passengers are indeed a threat to aircraft. In the US alone, there are about 2.5 million airplane passengers each day and security problems of any sort rarely happen. So the accuracy of the no-input classifier is something like 99.999%.\nThe actual screening system, using metal detectors, baggage x-rays, etc. will have a lower accuracy. We know this since it regularly mis-identifies innocent people as security problems.\nThe problem here is not with airport security screening, but with the flawed use of accuracy as a measure of performance. Indeed, achieving super-high accuracy is not the objective of the security screening process. Instead, the objective is to deter security problems by convincing potential terrorists that they are likely to get caught before they can get on a plane. This has to do with the sensitivity of the system. The specificity of the system, although important to the everyday traveller, is not what deters the terrorist."
