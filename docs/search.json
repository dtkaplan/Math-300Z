Often, the regulations attempt to protect juveniles—animals that have not yet reached reproductive age. If the juveniles are harvested, their potential progeny are annihilated. There are various ways to do this, for instance restricting fishing to months where adults are most prevalent, closing fisheries to provide an opportunity for the reproductive stock to recover, and so on.\nIn the 1990s, one of the ways the Federal government regulated scallop fisheries was by setting a minimum acceptable size for harvested scallops. For practical reasons, rather than monitoring individual scallops, the government monitored the average per scallop weight of each boat’s catch. For the sake of the example, imagine that the minimum acceptable weight is 1/30 pound.\nA fishing boat might have 10,000 or more bags of scallops, which can be handled individually: weigh the bag, then count the number of scallops to get the average weight per scallop.\nDiscussion questions:\n\nHow many bags should be sampled? Should this depend on the number of bags in the cargo. For instance, should a cargo of 1000 bags be sampled differently than a cargo of 10,000 bags.\nWhat should be the threshold for declaring the whole cargo below minimum size? (The whole catch is confiscated in such a case.)\n\nIn this section of the course, you’ll learn some statistical concepts and methods that allow the above questions to be answered to produce a regulation that is protective and fair to the fishermen.\nOne idea is very simple: sampling variation. This is about how much the average per-scallop weight will vary from one bag to another.\nAnother idea is very subtle: What you can say about the whole cargo based on a sample of \\(n\\) bags.\n\n\n\n\nWhy variation is central to thinking about data.\nHow to measure variation: the variance.\nAccounting with variance: what’s explained and what’s still not explained."

    "text": "Saving Lives\nA tourniquet is a belt-like device used to cut off the blook supply to a damaged and severely bleeding limb. A 2014 study of 1413 US casualities in Afghanistan and Iraq concluded that “those who received tourniquets had survival rates similar to those of comparable, transfused casualties who did not receive tourniquets.” That study was careful to take into account injury severity when comparing the casualties with tourniquets to those without. (JF Kragh et al. (2014) “Transfusion for Shock in US Military War Casualties With and Without Tourniquet Use” Annals of Emergency Medicine 65(3) link)\nThe study authors pointed out a potential bias in the collection of data. Only those soldiers who survived up to arrival at the hospital were included.\nConsider these four factors:\n\nInjury SEVERITY\nTourniquet USE (at the battle location)\nADMISSION, that is, arrival at the hospital\nPost-Admission SURVIVAL\n\nTASK: Construct a directed acyclic graph with a node for each of these factors. Draw directed causal links between each pair of nodes that you think are likely to be connected. For each link that you draw, make sure to show the direction of causation, giviving a few words of explanation. Similarly, when there is a pair of nodes without a direct connection, explain why not.\n \n \n \nNote: The direct paths you draw may create longer, indirect paths. For instance, \\(\\mathbb{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}\\) has direct paths between \\(\\mathbb{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) as well as between \\(\\mathbb{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{C}\\). However, there is no direct connection between \\(\\mathbb{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{C}\\).\n\nReference: J Pearl and D Mackenzie (2018) The Book of Why pp343-7"

    "text": "Signal and noise\nElectrical signaling is one of the means of cell-to-cell communication in organisms. Familiar examples are nerve cells and muscle cells. The electrical activity is mediated by assemblies of a few proteins—called “membrane channels”—that penetrate the cell membrane and switch minute flows of electrical current on and off depending on conditions in the cell and the influence of neighboring cells.\nAmazingly, even though this activity involves only thousands of atoms, it is possible to record the on-again-off-again activity of a single channel. (The 1991 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to E. Neher and B. Sakmann for their invention of the measurement technique, which is now widely used in electrophysiology research.)\nThe figure shows 16 recordings of the activity of different channels. Each of the recordings is a combination of signal and noise.\nTASK: In three recordings of your choice,\n\nIdentify the signal by drawing it over the recording.\nMeasure the typical amplitude of the noise. For this purpose, use the guide at the lower-right corner of the figure: a short vertical line marks the amplitude of 5 pA, that is, 5 pico-Amps.\n\nTo identify the signal, you need to know something about what the signal looks like. In our work in Math 300Z, the “signal” corresponds to a relationship between two variables or more. Here, one of the variables is time, the other is electrical current. Usually in Math 300Z we will be interested in “linear” relationships between the variables and we seek to identify the signal using only that limited piece of information. To define the signal in the single-channel recordings, use this information: the channels open and close to current, occasionally staying open (or closed) for the better part of a second, but also opening (or closing) for a much shorter time, say 0.01 second.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource of image: Kawano, R., Tsuji, Y., Sato, K. et al. (2013) “Automated Parallel Recordings of Topologically Identified Single Ion Channels”.
