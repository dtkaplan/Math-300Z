## Software 

The POSIT.cloud workspaces will already have the packages installed. If you are running RStudio on your laptop (that is, not in a browser), the following command will install the packages.

```r
install.packages(c("mosaic", "ggplot", "dplyr", "openintro", "moderndive", "nycflights13", "knitr"))
# addition package for Math 300Z
remotes::install_github("dtkaplan/math300")
```
