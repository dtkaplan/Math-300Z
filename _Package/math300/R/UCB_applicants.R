#' @details In 1973, officials at the University of California Berkeley noticed
#' disturbing trends in graduate admissions rates. The data, with department names redacted,
#' was presented and interpretted in a famous paper in *Science*, Bickel et al. 1975. In
#' that paper, summary tables were presented. `UCB_applicants` was reverse
#' engineered from `datasets::UCBAdmissions` into
#' a data table where the unit of observation is an individual applicant. The origin of
#' `datasets::UCBAdmissions` is not clear; those data are not explicitly provided in Bickel et al.

#' - `admit`: Whether the applicant was admitted.
#' - `gender`: male or female
#' - `dept`: The graduate department applied to. Rather than identifying the actual
#' departments involved, the data released by Berkeley used letter codes.
