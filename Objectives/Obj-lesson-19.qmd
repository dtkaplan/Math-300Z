19.1 Use the *response vs. explanatory* (**RESPEX**) format for data graphics, employing jittering as appropriate. Display density distributions using a violin graphic.

19.2 Use the *variance* to measure the amount of variation in a quantitative variable. 
    a. Convert a *variance* into the corresponding *standard deviation*. 
    b. Properly display a standard deviation on a RESPEX-format graph.

19.3 Compute, interpret, and display the *fitted model values* and the *residuals*.
