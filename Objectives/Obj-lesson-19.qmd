19.1 Distinguish between the two settings for decision-making: 

a. **Prediction**: predict an outcome for an individual
b. **Relationship**: characterize a relationship with an eye toward intervention or a better understanding of how a mechanism works.
    
19.2 Given a research question, identify whether it corresponds to a prediction setting or a relationship setting.

19.3 Understand the covering of a variable by an interval specified by a coverage level (e.g. 0.95).

19.4 Use "violin" plots to display the density of a variable. (This should really go in the first half of the course, but ModernDive doesn't do it.)
