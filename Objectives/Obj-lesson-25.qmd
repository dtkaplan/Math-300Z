25.1 Given a data frame, construct a predictor function for a specified response variable.

25.2 Use the predictor function to estimate prediction error and summarize with root mean square (RMS) error. 

25.3 Distinguish between the two settings for decision-making: 

    a. **Prediction**: predict an outcome for an individual
    b. **Relationship**: characterize a relationship with an eye toward intervention or a better understanding of how a mechanism works.
    
    Given a research question, identify whether it corresponds to a prediction setting or a relationship setting.
