25.1 Given a data frame, construct a predictor function for a specified response variable.

25.2 Use the predictor function to estimate prediction error and summarize with root mean square (RMS) error. Relate this to a prediction interval.

25.3 Distinguish between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction estimates of prediction error.
