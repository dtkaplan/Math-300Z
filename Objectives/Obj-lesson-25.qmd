25.1 Given a sample from a  DAG simulation, construct a predictor function for a specified response variable.

25.2 Use the predictor function to estimate prediction error on a given DAG sample and summarize with root mean square (RMS) error.

25.3 Distinguish between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction estimates of prediction error.
