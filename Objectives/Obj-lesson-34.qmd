34.1. Build a classifier from case-control data.

34.2. Cross-tabulate classifier results versus true state. Evaluate false-positive rate, false-negative rate, accuracy.

34.3. Calculate different forms of conditional probability: p(A|B) versus p(B|A) and identify which form of conditional probability is useful for prediction of an individual's outcome.
