22.1 Describe the logical origin of sampling variation as the variation between multiple samples from the same source.

22.2 Recognize the several formats in which we describe sampling variation---sampling variance, standard error, margin of error, confidence interval---and show how they are related. 

22.3 Identify how sampling variance scales with sample size $n$ and use this to estimate---given a single sample---how large the sampling variation would be in a sample of a different size.
