22.1 Implement on the computer a procedure to generate a sample, calculate a regression model, and produce a summary.

22.2 Iterate the procedure and collect the summaries across iterations. This collection is called the "sampling distribution."

22.3 Graphically display the distribution of summaries and generate a compact numerical description of the sampling distribution.
