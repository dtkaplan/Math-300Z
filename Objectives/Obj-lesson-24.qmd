24.1 Distinguish between the two settings for decision-making: 

    a. **Prediction**: predict an outcome for an individual
    b. **Relationship**: characterize a relationship with an eye toward intervention or a better understanding of how a mechanism works.
    
    Given a research question, identify whether it corresponds to a prediction setting or a relationship setting.


24.2 Estimate an effect size from a regression model of one and two variables.

24.3 Construct a confidence interval on the effect size and evaluate whether a confidence interval indicates that estimated effect size is consistent with a specified value.
