An experiment is something everybody believes, except the person who made it.*\n\nA graphical causal network is a kind of theory. As a theory, it's natural for people to be skeptical about results stem from the theory. Experiments are more persuasive. Let's consider what an experiment looks like when represented by a graphical causal networks.\n\nIn an experiment, you have some real-world system and a means to intervene physically on at least one of the variables in that system and to read out the response of the system to the intervention. You don't necessarily know much about the actual structure of the real world system. In @fig-experiment-system the real-world system is shown in the rounded box. The intervention is on X and the output is Y.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An experiment is a system in which there is an intervention and an output.](www/experiment-system.png){#fig-experiment-system width=291}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that in @fig-experiment-system X is, potentially, affected by other variables in the system.\n\nIdeally, the experiment is set up to eliminate all other effects on X except the intervention as in @fig-experiment-pure. And the intervention is done in a way that none of the variables in the system can have any effect on it, for instance by assigning the intervention using a **computer random-number generator**. The lovely thing about this configuration is that the correct model to capture the effect of `X` on `Y` is simply `Y ~ X`. Whatever different people might believe about the real-world mechanism doesn't matter. The correct model is always `Y ~ X`. This is why Einstein's statement, \"An experiment is something everybody believes,\" is justified.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An ideal experiment is one where the *only* influence on X is the intervention. Any effect on X or the intervention of the other variables in the system has been eliminated. The input paths to X from C and D that appear in @fig-experiment-system have been deleted by the experimenter. This is not always possible in practice.](www/experiment-pure.png){#fig-experiment-pure width=291}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut there is another part to Einstein's statement: \"... except the person who made it.\" Why shouldn't the experimenter believe her own experiment? The experimenter might know that she didn't or couldn't conduct an ideal experiment. She wasn't actually able to eliminate the arrows D $\\rightarrow$ X and C $\\rightarrow$ X. The other variables in the system might also be influencing X as in @fig-experiment-system. In this situation, the right model may not be Y `~` X. In fact, for the particular system shown in @fig-experiment-system the correct model would be Y `~` X + C + D. But how could the experimenter know this for sure if she didn't know all about the real-world mechanism?\n\nIt turns out that for either of the causal systems in [Figures @fig-experiment-system or @fig-experiment-pure] there is always a correct model to show the link between the intervention and output: Output `~` Intervention. Rather than modeling the output by the physical quantity X, model the output by the random numbers generated by the computer that were used to set the intervention. This modeling approach is called **intent to treat**.\n\nTypically, experiments are done using a specially constructed system that is thought to resemble the system on which the intervention will actually be done. Insofar as the experimental system does resemble the real-world system, the experimental results will anticipate the effect of the real-world intervention. But often it's hard to establish that the experimental system is a match to the system on which the real-world intervention will be applied. As such, subjective belief is still a factor in accepting that the experiment will be informative about the real-world systems we work with.\n \n",
