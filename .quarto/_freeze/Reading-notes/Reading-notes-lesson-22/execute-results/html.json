Historians go back to original documents, but inevitably many of the documents have been lost or destroyed: a source of noise. Even in elections, where you would think counting is straightforward, the voters' intentions are measured imperfectly due to \"hanging chads,\" \"butterfly ballots,\" broken voting machines, spoiled ballots, and so on. \n\nThe statistical thinker is well advised to know about the sources of noise in the system she is studying. Your analysis of data will be better the more you know about how measurements are made and data collected.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Noise in hiring\n\nThe author has on several occasions testified in legal hearings as a statistical expert. In one case, the US Department of Labor had audited the records of a contractor with several hundred employees and high turnover. The records led the Department to bring suit against the contractor for discriminating against Hispanics, and open-and-shut case. How so? The hiring records showed that many Hispanics applied for jobs but none of them was hired. \n\nAs the statistical expert, I was asked to review the findings from the Department of Labor. The lawyers thought they were asking me to check the arithmetic. As a statistical thinker, I know that the arithmetic is only part of the story. You also have to investigate the data. Although I had the spreadsheets to work from, I asked to be given the complete files on all applicants and hires the previous year. \n\nHere's what happened. There were indeed many Hispanic applicants, as shown both by the spreadsheet files and the paper job applications. And the spreadsheets showed no hires of Hispanics. But often the data on the job application form wasn't consistent with the data on hires. It turned out that whenever an applicant was hired, the contractor (per regulation) got a report on that person from the state police. But the report returned by the state police had only two available race/ethnicities: white and Black. The personnel office in the contractor filled in the hired-worker spreadsheet based on the state police report. So all the Hispanic applicants who were hired had been transformed into white or Black by the state police. Noise.\n:::\n\n## Sampling variation\n\nThere is one source of noise that is so common across many settings that every statistical thinker needs to be intimately familiar with. This is called \"**sampling variation**.\"\n\nWe've been using \"sample\" as a near synonym for \"data frame.\" But that's not completely fair. Often, data frames contain a row for each and every \"item\" of relevance. For instance, the Department of Labor never suggested that the contractor in the previous example had left out some of the applicants. Such a complete enumeration---the inventory records of a merchant, the records kept of student grades by the school registrar---has a technical name: a \"**census**.\"\nFamously, many countries have a regular census of the population---every 10 years in the US or the UK or China---in which (they try to) reach out to every resident.\n\nBut there are many settings where it is unfeasible to collect data in the form of a census. The records will be incomplete and therefore constitute a \"**sample**.\" Sampling is called for when we want to find out about a large group but don't have the resources---time, energy, money---to contact every member of the group. France, in order to collect up-to-date data while staying within a budget, runs a \"rolling census\" where samples are made at short time intervals. It's estimated that the French rolling census ultimately reaches 70% of the population.\n\nSometimes, as in quality control in manufacturing, the measurement process is destructive: the item is consumed in the process of measurement. Then, of course, it would be pointless to make a measurement of every single item. A sample will have to do.\n\nCollecting a reliable sample is usually a lot of work. One idealization is called a \"simple random sample\" (SRS) where all of the items are available, but only some are selected, at random, to be recorded as data. The work comes from having to assemble all of the items. Making a SRS calls for first assembling a \"sampling frame,\" which is essentially a census. If a census is unfeasible, the construction of a perfect sampling frame is hardly less so.\n\nProfessional work, such as the collection of unemployment data, often requires government-level resources and draws on specialized statistical techniques such as stratified sampling and weighting of the results. We won't cover the specialized techniques in this introductory course, even though they are very important in creating representative samples. If you're interested in seeing what's involved, you can get an idea by scrolling through the table of contents of a classic text, William Cochran's [*Sampling techniques*](https://ia801409.us.archive.org/35/items/Cochran1977SamplingTechniques_201703/Cochran_1977_Sampling%20Techniques.pdf)\n\nAll statistical thinkers, whether expert in sampling techniques or not, should be aware of factors that can bias a sample away from being representative. **Non-response bias** can be significant, even overwhelming, in surveys. In political polls, many (most?) people will not respond to the questions. If this non-response stems from, for example, an expectation that the response will be unpopular, then the poll sample won't adequately reflect unpopular opinions.\n\n**Survival bias** is an important consideration in many settings. An example is given by the `mosaicData::TenMileRace` data. This records the running times of 8636 participants in a 10-mile road race held in 2005 and includes information about the runner, such as his or her age. You might think that such data could tell you about changes in running performance as people age: the data frame includes runners from age 10 to 87. But a model of running time as a function of age from this data frame is seriously biased. The reason? As people age, casual runners tend to drop out of such races. So the older runners are skewed toward higher performance. (We can see this by taking a different approach to the sample: collecting data over multiple years and tracking individual runners as they age.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Examples: Returned to base\n\nAn inspiring story about dealing with survival bias comes from a World War II study of the damage sustained by bombers due to enemy guns. The sample, by necessity, included only those bombers that survived the mission and returned to base. The shell holes in those surviving bombers were not representative of where shells hit the planes, they were only representative of shell hits that did not prevent the plane from returning. The study report, [available here](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA091073.pdf), is a tribute the the work and ingenuity needed to deal with issues such as survival bias. The report itself doesn't contain any diagram showing where shells it the bombers, but a hypothetical diagram on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) conveys the idea.\n\n![](www/bomber-holes.png)\n:::\n\nThe shell holes on the surviving planes were clustered in certain areas. The clustering stems from survivor bias. Planes that were it in the areas, such as the middle of the wings, the cockpit, the engines, and the back of the fusalage did not return to base. Consequently, those shell hits were never recorded.\n\n## Measuring sampling variation\n\nWe start the process of learning about sampling variation on the training ground. That is, we'll use simulations from DAGs even though our ultimate goal is to work with real data. DAGs are a convenient training tool because the data generated is always a simple random sample and we can generate any number of samples of any size we wish. In the spirit of starting simply, we'll return to `dag01` which, you may remember, has the structure $\\mathtt{x}\\longrightarrow\\mathtt{y}$ and the causal formula `y ~ 4 + 1.5 * x + eps(x)`.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that sampling variation is not about the row-to-row variation in a single sample, it is about the variation in the summary from one sample to another. So our initial process for exploring sampling variation will be to carry out many trials, each of which is a summary of a sample. \n\nTo illustrate, here is one trial using a sample of size $n=25$. There are many ways to summarize a sample, here we will use `y ~ 1`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSample <- sample(dag01, size=25) \nSample %>% \n  lm(y ~ 1, data = .) %>%\n  coefficients()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Intercept) \n   4.622099 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can't see sampling variation directly in the above result because there is only one trial. To see sampling variation directly, we need to run *many* trials. In each trial, a new sample (of size $n=25$ is taken and summarized.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTrials <- do(100) * {\n  Sample <- sample(dag01, size=25) \n  Sample %>% \n    lm(y ~ 1, data = .) %>%\n    coefficients()\n}\nTrials\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Intercept\n1    4.325743\n2    4.259373\n3    3.774027\n4    4.260662\n5    3.774720\n6    4.504612\n7    4.324866\n8    3.886647\n9    4.221058\n10   4.181181\n11   4.164594\n12   4.009576\n13   3.777807\n14   4.236963\n15   3.972496\n16   3.804015\n17   4.336199\n18   4.157989\n19   3.845247\n20   4.551283\n21   4.201726\n22   4.279147\n23   4.197916\n24   4.403323\n25   4.205382\n26   4.683501\n27   4.122489\n28   3.973316\n29   3.858270\n30   4.298748\n31   3.584820\n32   4.416405\n33   4.233296\n34   4.135118\n35   3.638739\n36   4.271793\n37   4.012241\n38   3.694062\n39   4.177496\n40   2.712570\n41   3.156607\n42   4.145464\n43   4.275481\n44   4.108306\n45   3.653740\n46   3.953338\n47   3.786200\n48   3.362691\n49   3.390494\n50   4.063216\n51   4.254318\n52   3.524185\n53   3.869243\n54   4.496233\n55   4.153982\n56   4.731352\n57   4.097335\n58   4.321772\n59   4.961461\n60   3.964094\n61   4.147353\n62   3.390652\n63   4.523000\n64   4.577773\n65   4.310574\n66   4.622263\n67   4.676236\n68   3.428335\n69   3.836534\n70   4.139999\n71   3.822753\n72   3.569538\n73   3.241943\n74   3.906785\n75   4.093538\n76   4.178026\n77   4.176137\n78   3.298370\n79   4.842166\n80   3.863946\n81   3.878656\n82   3.981178\n83   3.719393\n84   4.099604\n85   4.239947\n86   3.684081\n87   3.880939\n88   4.138508\n89   4.229457\n90   4.296386\n91   4.014592\n92   4.053822\n93   4.283775\n94   4.234725\n95   4.531647\n96   4.090854\n97   4.102844\n98   3.440418\n99   4.196119\n100  3.755595\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`Trials` is a *sample of summaries*. In `Trials`, the sampling variation can indeed be seen in the row-to-row variation in the data frame, but only because the data frame is a summary of samples. Since it is hard to read columns of numbers, we will *summarize* the variation in the *sample of summaries*. \n\nAs always, our standard measure of variation is the standard deviation (or, equivalently, variance):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTrials %>%\n  summarize(sIntercept = sd(Intercept))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  sIntercept\n1  0.3778659\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis quantity, which is the standard deviation of a sample of summaries, has a technical name in statistics: the **standard error**. The words **standard error** should properly be followed by a description of the summary and the size of the individual samples involved. Here it would be, \"0.348 is the standard error of the Intercept coefficient from a sample of size 25.\n\nThe standard error is an ordinary standard deviation, but in a particular context: the standard deviation of a sample of summaries. This can be confusing, since \"error\" and \"deviation\" are somewhat synonomous in everyday language. It can be hard to remember when to use \"error\" and when to use \"deviation.\" Fortunately, it's more common to use another way to present the information about sampling variation.\n\n\n## The confidence interval\n\nThe \"confidence interval\" is a more user-friendly format for describing the amount of sampling variation. As an interval, it commonly written either as [lower, upper] or center$\\pm$half-width. These styles are completely equivalent and either style can be used. The preferred style can depend on the field or the journal in which a report is being published. Some journals like a different style, center (half-width). \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Technical vocabulary\n\nThere is a technical name for the half-width: the \"**margin of error**.\" We will leave the confidence interval calculation to software, so we won't have much need to refer to the margin of error, but it is a term commonly used by statisticians and scientists.\n:::\n\nThe margin of error is defined to be twice the SE. A lot of early statistical theory was given over to defining \"twice.\" For our purposes, twice means \"multiply by 2.\" Some people prefer the theoretically more precise \"multiply by 1.96\" which is appropriate for very large sample sizes. For small sample sizes \"twice\" is larger than 1.96 and depends on how many model coefficients there are. For instance, consider the simplest model `y ~ 1`. There is one coefficient and for a sample size of $n=20$ twice would be 2.09 while a for a sample size of $n=5$ \"twice\" would be 2.8. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Demonstration: Confidence interval on the Intercept coefficient for $n=25$\n\nThe following command computes the confidence interval (that is, the two numbers [`lower`,`upper`]) for the trials we ran on samples of size $n=25$ from `dag01` and summarized by the intercept coefficient from `y ~ 1`.  We show this just to make clear what that the margin of error is twice the standard error. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTrials %>%\n  summarize(m=mean(Intercept), se=sd(Intercept)) %>%\n  mutate(lower = m - 2*se, upper = m + 2*se)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         m        se    lower    upper\n1 4.052374 0.3778659 3.296642 4.808106\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nNotice that we have used 2 for \"twice.\" But best to leave the detailed calculations to the software.\n:::\n\nStatistical software is written to use the correct value of \"twice\" for any given sample size and number of coefficients. But for everyday purposes, and samples larger than, say, $n=10$, \"twice\" is roughly 2.\n\nIn calculations, finding the half-width of the confidence interval requires first finding the standard error, then multiplying by \"twice.\" In practice, it's far easier to use software. In R, the `confint()` function reports the confidence interval for model coefficients:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nHill_racing %>% \n  lm(time ~ distance + climb, data=.) %>% \n  confint()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                  2.5 %      97.5 %\n(Intercept) -533.432471 -406.521402\ndistance     246.387096  261.229494\nclimb          2.493307    2.726209\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Demonstration: How many digits?\n\nIn the calculation of confidence intervals on the model `time ~ distance + climb`, the results were reported to many digits. Such a report is appropriate for whatever further calculations might need to be done on the results, but it is usually not appropriate for a human reader.\n\nTo know how many digits are worth reporting to humans, you can look at the standard error. The standard error is a part of a different kind of summary of a model: the \"regression report.\" We won't need to look at regression reports until the end of the course. We show one here just to make the point about how many digits are worth reporting to humans.\n\nHere's the regression report on the `Hill_racing` model\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nHill_racing %>% \n  lm(time ~ distance + climb, data=.) %>% \n  broom::tidy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)  -470.     32.4        -14.5 9.92e- 46\n2 distance      254.      3.78        67.1 0        \n3 climb           2.61    0.0594      43.9 4.08e-304\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe \"standard error\" for each coefficient is reported in the column labelled `std.error`. \n\nFor the human reader, only the first two significant digits of the standard error are worth reporting. In this case, that is 32 for the Intercept, 3.8 for the distance coefficient, and 0.059 for the climb coefficient. The confidence interval will be the coefficient itself (column labelled `estimate`) plus-or-minus \"twice\" the `std.error`. The report of the confidence interval (for a human reader) should be rounded to the place of the first two significant digits of the standard error.\n\nFor example, the confidence interval on the distance coefficient will be $253.808295 \\pm 2 \\times 3.78433220$. Keep only the digits that come before the first two significant digits of the SE, so\nthe reported interval can be $253.8 \\pm 3.8$. \n:::\n",
