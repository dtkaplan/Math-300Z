How many p-values are being reported from the regression report? Bonferroni adjustment. Compare to ANOVA format which looks at the term as a whole.  Also look at the large number of indicators of batting performance. How many different tests could we perform?\n\n\n\n\n## 37.1\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Solution\n\n:::\n\n--------\n\n\n## Documenting software\n\n  \n\n",
