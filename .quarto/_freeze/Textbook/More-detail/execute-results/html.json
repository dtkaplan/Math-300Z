Around 1907, William Gosset, a scientist at Guinness, discovered that such coincidences force \"twice\" to be $> 2$ in order to produce confidence intervals that reliably cover the mean of the data-generating process. Gosset's particular interest was in making sense of Guinness's standard testing protocols, which involve averaging the results from three small batches of beer ingredients. Contacting the leading statisticians of the day, Gosset was told that such small $n$ is \"brewing, not statistics.\" Nonetheless, Gosset had to work within Guinness's testing protocols, which were indeed brewing but still needed statistical interpretation. \n\nGosset carried out trials by hand, a large number of measurements from a study of criminals' hand sizes. (They did this kind of thing in 1900.)  Each measurement was written on a card. A trial consisted of drawing $n$ cards from the deck and calculating the mean and standard deviation of the measurements. Using computers, we can simulate the calculation of results from a Gosset-like trials using a simple function that calculates the mean and standard deviation of data from a Gaussian distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_trial <- function(n=2) {\n  vals <- rnorm(n)\n  tibble(m = mean(vals), s = sd(vals))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can pick a small $n$ and running many trials using a candidate value for \"twice.\"\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## IN DRAFT\n\nCONVERT the `beta` to something named `twice`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn=10\nbeta <- 2 / sqrt(n)\nTrials <- do(100) * one_trial(n=n) %>% \n  mutate(left = m - beta*s, right = m + beta*s) \ngf_errorbarh(.index ~ left + right, data = Trials, alpha=0.5) %>%\n  gf_errorbarh(.index ~ left + right, \n               data = Trials %>% filter(left > 0 | right < 0)) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ 0, color=\"blue\", inherit=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](More-detail_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nGosset effectively tabulated the $\\beta$ multipliers\n\nn  | $\\beta$ | $t = \\beta / \\sqrt{\\strut n}$\n---|---------|------------------\n2  | 8.98    | 12.7\n3  | 2.48    | 4.30\n4  | 1.59    | 3.18\n5  | 1.24    | 2.78\n6  | 1.04    | 2.57\n7  | 0.92    | 2.44\n$\\vdots$ |  |\n10 | 0.72    | 2.26\n15 | 0.55    | 2.14\n20 | 0.47    | 2.09\n50 | 0.28    | 2.01\n100 | 0.20   | 1.98\n500 | 0.088  | 1.96\n1000 | 0.062 | 1.96\n\nYou can see that for $n$ bigger than 10 or 20, the $t$ multiplier is 2. But for very small $n$, the t-multiplier can be considerably larger. \n\nYou can see the wisdom of brewers here. They made tests by averaging measurements from three small batches of beer. If they had used only two batches, the confidence interval would be almost three times larger than for $n=3$, making it very hard to conclude anything about whether the tests show the ingredients to be within the quality-control standards.\n\nGosset's work was published under the pseudonym \"Student,\" since Guinness forbade employees to publish under their own names. Statisticians, recognizing the value of the work (and knowing the name behind the pseudonym), came to use the name $t$, perhaps because tea was considered more refined than \"beer.\" In many statistics texts, you will see the phrase \"Student t\" to refer to how Gosset's work is used.\n\n## Interaction\n\nRETURN TO THIS MODEL, but add an interaction.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMod3 <- lm(list_price ~ hard_paper + num_pages, data = amazon_books)\nmodel_eval(Mod3, hard_paper = c(\"P\", \"H\"),  num_pages=c(200, 400))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  hard_paper num_pages  .output       .lwr     .upr\n1          P       200 14.52494 -12.641928 41.69182\n2          H       200 19.48253  -7.785720 46.75077\n3          P       400 18.43605  -8.709404 45.58151\n4          H       400 23.39363  -3.847698 50.63497\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Prediction interval\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Demonstration: Simple-minded data analysis shows why\n\nWe constructed our model of running time using the \"linear least-squares\" modeling methodology implemented by the `lm()` model-training function. For the purpose of demonstration, we'll show you a simple-minded method to make a prediction. This simple-minded method would give results more or less equivalent to the least squares method if we had an almost infinite amount of data. Since we don't, the simple-minded method is not as reliable as the least-squares method.\n\nRemember our goal: to predict the running time for a 10km race with a 500m climb. All that we have to inform the prediction is the historical data contained in the `Hill_racing` data frame. The simple-minded method is ... well ... simple to understand. We will pull out from the `Hill_racing` data frame those rows where the race distance is close to 10km and the race climb is close to 500m. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclose_rows <- Hill_racing %>%\n  filter(9 <= distance, distance <= 11,\n         450 <= climb, climb <= 550)\n## the prediction\nclose_rows %>% summarize(sample_size=n(), pred = mean(time))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  sample_size  pred\n        <int> <dbl>\n1          52 3523.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nYou might not agree with our definition of \"close to 10km\" as \"between 9 and 11\", and similarly for `climb`.\n\nTo get the confidence interval on this simple-minded prediction, we point out that the value of the mean time is the same as the coefficient from the model `time ~ 1`. Let's fit that model formula to the `close_rows` and look at the coefficient and confidence interval. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimple_mod <- lm(time ~ 1, data = close_rows)\nsimple_mod %>% coefficients()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Intercept) \n   3523.481 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimple_mod %>% confint()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 3363.901 3683.061\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo interpret this confidence interval, we can plot the actual running times and compare them to the interval, as in @fig-running-prediction-conf\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(close_rows, aes(y=time, x=1)) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.2) + xlim(0,2) +\n  geom_violin(fill=\"blue\", alpha=0.2, color=NA) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=3364, ymax=3683), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=1665, ymax=5082, x=1.5), color=\"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The rows from `Hill_racing` with a distance close to 10km and climb close to 500m.

One of his statistical inventions is the \"coefficient of determination\" now universally called R^2^ and a widely used, basic summary of statistical models. In 1921, he invented \"path analysis.\" One of his \"path diagrams\" is shown in @fig-path-guinea-pig.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"GET THIS FROM p.75 of the *Book of Why*\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHis path diagrams are directed acyclic graphs, DAGs, augmented with coefficients representing the relative strength of each contributor to a node. He worked out the algebra of the correlation induced by the graph between any two nodes. Then, by measuring the R^2^ between pairs of nodes, he was able in some cases to work backwards to numerical values for the coefficients.\n\nWright's path diagrams are the historically earliest form of our DAGs. In his honor, we've constructed a DAG to represent one of his calculations, how much the body weight at birth of a guinea pig increases due to one day longer in the womb. The path diagram Wright imagined is drawn below, though we have left out the coefficients from the display.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](More-detail_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can't measure the growth rate directly, but we can measure liter size, gestation length, and birth weight. But how can we estimate the direct effect of growth rate when it is confounded with the other causal pathways?\n\nSewall's breeding experiments would have provided data like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> liter_size </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> growth_rate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> weight </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 86 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 109 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 110 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 96 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 80 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 99 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou might think that weight gain per day of gestation can be simply calculated as `weight/gestation`, but this ignores the fact that weight gain is slow early in gestation and faster as the cubs develop. Instead, using a model `weight ~ gestation` lets us look at the marginal impact of an extra day of gestation. The coefficients from this model indicates that weight increases by 6.8 grams per extra day of gestation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(weight ~ gestation, data = Pigs) %>% confint()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept) -41.516920 -23.371468\ngestation     6.360907   7.320027\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut Wright knew that this number was misleading. Larger liters tend to have shorter gestation times. And larger liters produce cubs that weigh less. With more computational power available to us, we can use a simpler calculation to incorporate these facts into the estimation of weight gain per day of gestation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(weight ~ gestation + liter_size, data = Pigs) %>% confint()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                 2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept)  93.676267 114.720621\ngestation     4.136628   4.868731\nliter_size  -19.026171 -16.829170\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis model pegs the growth rate at about 4.5 grams per day. \n\nSince we generated the data from a DAG, we have the luxury of measuring the actual growth rate used for each liter. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPigs %>% summarize(rate = mean(growth_rate))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   rate\n  <dbl>\n1  4.84\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCovariates help us deal with confounding! Unfortunately, the statistical bigwigs of the 1920s through 1950s poo-pooed Wright's ideas about path analysis.

It's harder to see how reducing spending in one area---the cash payment to people not on the insurance plan---can increase spending overall. I might have been more successful convincing the college budget committee not to eliminate the cash payment if they had understood the language of DAGs. @fig-insurance-two-dags shows two competing DAGs for the situation:\n\n\n::: {#fig-insurance-two-dags .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![One path from cash to expenditures](More-detail_files/figure-html/fig-insurance-two-dags-1.png){#fig-insurance-two-dags-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two paths from cash to expenditures](More-detail_files/figure-html/fig-insurance-two-dags-2.png){#fig-insurance-two-dags-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nTwo different DAGs relevant to the debate about eliminating the cash payment to employees not on the college's health care plan.\n:::\n\n\nThe people on the budget committee saw clearly the direct link between the cash payment and total expenditures and likely would not have disputed a direct link between enrollment and expenditures. But they didn't imagine a link between the cash payment and enrollment. I did, because I knew of several colleagues who used their spouse's companies insurance plan, even though it was identical to the college's plan.\n\nThe situation with the drug aprotinin is similar. \n\n\n::: {#fig-drugs-two-dags .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![One path from cash to expenditures](More-detail_files/figure-html/fig-drugs-two-dags-1.png){#fig-drugs-two-dags-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two paths from cash to expenditures](More-detail_files/figure-html/fig-drugs-two-dags-2.png){#fig-drugs-two-dags-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nTwo different DAGs relevant to the link between aprontinin and mortality.\n:::\n",
