Create a scatterplot using the `ggplot()` function.\n\n2.  Interpret the relationship between variables in a scatterplot.\n\n3.  Refine and improve scatterplots to illustrate relevant points by preprocessing the data or using functions such as `alpha()` and `geom_jitter()`.\n\n## Reading\n\n[Chapter 2 - 2.3](https://moderndive.com/2-viz.html#needed-packages)\n\n## Lesson\n\nWork through the learning checks LC2.1 - LC2.8. Complete the code when necessary.\n\n### Setup\n\nWe need to load the required packages for this document:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n*We need to create the `alaska_flights` data object.* This is a subset of the `flights` dataset consisting only of those flown by the Alaskan Airlines carrier. Complete the code and remove the comment symbol #.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#alaska_flights <- ____________ %>% \n#  filter(carrier == \"______\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1 (Objective 3)\n\n**(LC 2.1)** Take a look at both the `flights` and `alaska_flights` data frames by running `View(flights)` and `View(alaska_flights)` in the console. In what respect do these data frames differ? For example, think about the number of rows in each dataset.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n### Additional Setup\n\n*Build the plot for the next set of learning checks.* We want to visualize the relationship between between two numerical variables: `dep_delay` (the departure delay on the horizontal \"x\" axis) and `arr_delay` (the arrival delay on the vertical \"y\" axis). Complete the code and remove the comment symbol #.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#ggplot(data = _______________, mapping = aes(x = ________________, y = arr_delay)) + \n#  geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 2 (Objective 2)\n\n**(LC 2.2)** What are some practical reasons why `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` have a positive relationship?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n### Exercise 3 (Objective 2)\n\n**(LC 2.3)** What variables in the `weather` data frame would you expect to have a negative correlation (i.e. a negative relationship) with `dep_delay`? Why? Remember that we are focusing on numerical variables here. Hint: Explore the `weather` dataset by using the `View()` function.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n### Exercise 4 (Objective 2)\n\n**(LC 2.4)** Why do you believe there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaskan flights?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n###Exercise 5 (Objective 2)\n\n**(LC 2.5)** What are some other features of the plot that stand out to you?\n\n**Solution**: Different people will answer this one differently. One answer is most flights depart and arrive less than an hour late.\n\n### Exercise 6 (Objective 1)\n\nCreate a new scatter plot with departure time in the x-axis and arrival delay in the y-axis using your work above.\n\n*To insert an `R` code chunk into a markdown, there is the pulldown menu but you can also use Ctrl-Alt-I.*\n\n**Solution**:\n\n### Exercise 7 (Objective 2)\n\n**(LC 2.7)** Why is setting the `alpha` argument value useful with scatterplots? What further information does it give you that a regular scatterplot cannot?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n### Exercise 8 (Objective 2, 3)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalaska_flights <- flights %>% \n  filter(carrier == \"AS\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Plot to use for this problem.\nggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 1: Arrival delays versus departure delays for Alaska Airlines flights from NYC in 2013.](Student-notes-lesson-02_files/figure-html/noalpha-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Second Plot to use for this problem.\nggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 2: Arrival vs. departure delays scatterplot with alpha = 0.2](Student-notes-lesson-02_files/figure-html/alpha-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**(LC 2.8)** After viewing the Figure 2 above, give an approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur the most frequently. How has that region changed compared to when you observed the same plot without the `alpha = 0.2` set in Figure 1?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n## Documenting software\n\n-   File creation date: 2023-01-17\n-   R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\n-   `ggplot2` package version: 3.4.0\n-   `dplyr` package version: 1.0.10\n-   `nycflights13` package version: 1.0.2\n",
