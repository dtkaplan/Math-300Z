As a starting point for our simulation, let's imagine that education outcomes increase with school expenditures in a very simple way: each $1000 increase in school expenditures per pupil results in an average increase of 10 points in the SAT score: an effect size of 0.01 points per dollar. Thus, the imagined relationship is:\n\n$$\\mbox{sat} = 1100 + 0.01 * \\mbox{dollar expenditure}$$\n\nImagine that the fraction of students taking the SAT test also influences the average test score with an effect size of -4 sat points per percentage point. Adding this effect into the simulation leads to an imagined relationship of\n\n$$\\mbox{sat} = 1100 + 0.01 * \\mbox{dollar expenditure} - 4 * \\mbox{participation percentage} .$$\n\nAnd, of course, there are other factors, but we'll treat their effect as random with a typical size of $\\pm$ 50 points.\n\nTo complete the simulation, we'll need to set values for dollar expenditures and participation percentage. We'll let the dollar expenditures vary randomly from $7000 to $18,000 from one state to another and the participation percentage vary randomly from 1 to 100 percentage points.\n\nNotice that in this simulation, both participation percentage and expenditures affect education outcomes, but there is no connection at all between the two explanatory variables. That is, the graphical causal network is that shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:school-sim-1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_school1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nexpenditure ~ unif(7000, 18000)\nparticipation ~ unif(1, 100)\noutcome ~ 1100 + 0.01 * expenditure - 4 * participation + exo(50)\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_draw(dag_school1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A graphical causal network relating expenditures, participation percentage, and education outcome, where there is no connection between expenditures and participation.](Student-notes-lesson-28_files/figure-html/fig-school-sim-1-1.png){#fig-school-sim-1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can generate simulated data and use the data to train models. @fig-school-data-1 shows the data and two different models.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDat1 <- sample(dag_school1, size=500)\nmod1_1 <- lm(outcome ~ ns(expenditure,2), data = Dat1)\nmod1_2 <- lm(outcome ~ ns(expenditure,2) * participation, data = Dat1)\nmod_plot(mod1_1, interval=\"prediction\") %>%\n  gf_point(outcome ~ expenditure, data = Dat1)\nmod_plot(mod1_2, interval=\"prediction\") %>%\n  gf_point(outcome ~ expenditure, alpha=~participation, data = Dat1, inherit=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data and models of the relationship between expenditures and education outcomes from a simulation in which expenditures and participation rate are unconnected as in @fig-school-sim-1.\n- (a) The model `outcome ~ expenditure` \n- (b) The model with participation as a covariate: `outcome ~ expenditure + participation` \nBoth models (a) and (b) show the same effect size for outcome with respect to expenditure.](Student-notes-lesson-28_files/figure-html/fig-school-data-1-1.png){#fig-school-data-1-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data and models of the relationship between expenditures and education outcomes from a simulation in which expenditures and participation rate are unconnected as in @fig-school-sim-1.\n- (a) The model `outcome ~ expenditure` \n- (b) The model with participation as a covariate: `outcome ~ expenditure + participation` \nBoth models (a) and (b) show the same effect size for outcome with respect to expenditure.](Student-notes-lesson-28_files/figure-html/fig-school-data-1-2.png){#fig-school-data-1-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe relationship between outcome and expenditure can be quantified by the effect size, which appears as the slope of the function.\nYou can see that when the explanatory variables are unconnected, as in @fig-school-sim-1, the functions have the same slope.\n\nNow consider a somewhat different simulation. Rather than expenditures and participation being unconnected (as in the causal diagram shown in @fig-school-sim-1), in this new situation, we will posit a connection between the two explanatory variables. We'll imagine that there is some broad factor, labeled \"culture\" in @fig-school-sim-2, that influences both the amount of expenditure and the participation in the tests used to measure education outcome. For instance, \"culture\" might be the importance that the community places on education or the wealth of the community.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_school2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nculture ~ unif(-1, 1)\nexpenditure ~ 12000 + 4000 * culture + exo(1000)\nparticipation ~ (50 + 30 * culture + exo(15)) %>% pmax(0) %>% \n    pmin(100)\noutcome ~ 1100 + 0.01 * expenditure - 4 * participation + exo(50)\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_draw(dag_school2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A DAG for school outcomes that links `participation` and `expenditure` as a function of `culture`.](Student-notes-lesson-28_files/figure-html/fig-school-sim2-1.png){#fig-school-sim2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAgain, using data from this simulation, we can train models:\n\n* (a) `outcome ~ expenditures`, which has no covariates.\n* (b) `outcome ~ expenditures + participation`, which includes participation as a covariate.\n\n@fig-school-data-2 shows the data from the new simulation (which is the same in both subplots) and the form of the function trained on the data.
