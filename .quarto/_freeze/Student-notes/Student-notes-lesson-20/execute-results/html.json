The sampling process leaves traces---called **sampling variation***---in the models we construct from data. This Lesson gives you simulation tools to observe and quantify sampling variation. We will use these throughout the Lessons that follow.\n\n\n### Reading \n\n[Lesson **20** from *LST*](https://dtkaplan.github.io/Math-300R/Textbook/Reading-notes-lesson-20.html)\n\n\n\n### Objectives\n\n\n20.1 Construct sampling trials from a data frame or a simulation. \n\n20.2 Replicate sampling trials and calculate the amount of sampling variability.\n\n20.3 Recognize properties of directed, acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n\n\n[Updated list of objectives](../Objectives/Obj-lesson-20.html)\n\n### Libraries \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic)\nlibrary(math300)\ndata(\"Whickham\", package=\"mosaicData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n--------\n\n\nLesson \n--------\n\nIn the real world, creating a sample can be a laborious process, perhaps requiring field, experimental work, or building instrumentation. We're going to skip the hard stuff, and simply use the R function `sample()` which can create a sample from a data frame or a DAG (or other things such as the `1:10` in the example).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(1:10, size = 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  9 10  6  2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote: The `size=` argument specifies the size of the sample to be collected. In the text, we follow statistical convention and always refer to the sample size with the letter $n$, as in \"collect a sample of size $n=6$. But `sample()` does *not* use $n$ as the name of the size-setting argument.\n\n### Exercise 1\n\n#### Task 1.1\n\nWrite the R command to take a sample of size $n = 5$ from the `Whickham` data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for Task 1.1\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer these questions:\n\n- Does `sample()` select from the rows or the columns of a data frame?\n- Will the same `sample()` command, when repeated, return the same sample?\n\n\n#### Task 1.2\n\nCompare the ages of the smokers and non-smokers in `Whickham` with this model:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote the `smokerYes` coefficient is about -4.0. Interpret the `smokerYes` coefficient in everyday language to explain what it says about the ages of smokers and non-smokers. \n\n*Your answer*: \n\n#### Task 1.3\n\nMake an appropriate RESPEX-format graph of `Whickham` suited to the model `age ~ smoker`. Add a violin layer to the data layer. (Make sure to set the transparency `alpha` and the `fill` and `color` for an intelligible display.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For task 1.3\n```\n:::\n\n\nFrom the graph, explain in everyday language why the violin is so narrow for smokers aged 65 and above.\n\n*Your answer*:\n\nWhy is there a waist in the violin for non-smokers at age 50, while the violin for smokers has a corresponding bulge? Explain in everyday language.\n\n*Your answer*:\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n#### Task 2.1\n\nWrite an R statement that will find the sample size $n$ of `Whickham`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find sample size of `Whickham`.\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the chunk below, copy the code from Task 1.1 to display the coefficients from the model `age ~ smoker`. But modify the code so that instead of using all of `Whickham` as training data, a sample size of $n=50$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Copy your code from Task 1.1, but set the sample size to n=50.\n```\n:::\n\n\nRun the above chunk several times, each time noting the coefficient `smokerYes`. The coefficient will differ from run to run: that's sampling variation. Which of these statements best describes the pattern? (Mark your answer **in bold**.)\n\na. The coefficients are always less than -4.0.\nb. The coefficients are always greater than -4.0\nc. The coefficients are scattered on both sides of -4.0.\n\n\n\n\n#### Task 2.2\n\nCopy your graphics code from Task 1.2, but modify it to set the sample size to $n=50$. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Copy the graphics code from Task 1.2, modified for a sample of size n=50.\nggplot(sample(Whickham, size=50), aes(x=smoker, y=age)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha=0.5, width=0.2) + \n  geom_violin(alpha=0.2, fill=\"blue\", color=NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-notes-lesson-20_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRepeat the command many times, each time checking the violin for signs of the non-smoker waist and smoker bulge at around age 50. \n\na. Does the waist-bulge pattern appear reliably for a sample of size $n=50$?  \nb. Find a sample size at which the waist-bulge pattern occurs at least 3/4 of the time?\n    \n*Your answer here:*\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nIn this exercise, you will practice with the `do()` function that lets you run multiple replications of a trial. \n\n#### Task 3.1\n\nIn this task, the trial will be very simple: Fit the `age ~ smoker` model to `Whickham` and display the coefficients. The code to run a trial is inside the curly braces `{ }`. The `do()` function goes before the curly braces. There is always a `*` sign between `do()` and the curly braces.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Trials <- do(5) * { lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef() }\n# Trials\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe collection of `Trials` is a data frame that includes the results from each trial, stacked one above the next.\n\nYou may be surprised to see that the columns of `Trials` repeat the same number over and over again. Explain what it is about the command inside the `{ }` that causes the result to be the same every time the trial is run. (See the next task if you can't figure it out.)\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n#### Task 3.2\n\nThe typical use for `do()` is to repeat trials, each of which involves some random component, such as drawing a sample.\n\nModify the code from Task 3.1 so that the training data is a sample of size $n=50$ from `Whickham`. Also, modify the argument to `do()` so that there will be 10 rows in `Trials`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# modify this code\n# Trials <- do(5) * { lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef() }\n# Trials\n```\n:::\n\n\nConfirm that the coefficients vary from trial to trial, that is, from one sample to another.\n\nTry several different sample sizes (that is, $n=100, 200, 300$). Does the amount of trial-to-trial variation in the coefficients get bigger or smaller as the sample size increases?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nYou can use `sample()` to take samples from a DAG. For instance, consider\n`dag02`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_draw(dag02)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-notes-lesson-20_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(dag02)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx ~ exo()\na ~ exo()\ny ~ 3 * x - 1.5 * a + 5 + exo()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(dag02, size=5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 Ã— 3\n       x       a     y\n   <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>\n1 -1.29  -0.0864 0.380\n2  1.35   0.342  9.39 \n3  1.39  -0.450  9.83 \n4 -0.983  0.402  2.42 \n5  0.803 -0.685  8.46 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Task 4.1\n\nHere is the code for a single trial in which a sample of size $n=5$ is collected from `dag02` and used to train the model `y ~ a + x`, which corresponds exactly to the formula for `y` in the DAG.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# lm(y ~ a + x, data=sample(dag02, size=5)) %>% coef()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the coefficients roughly match those in the `dag02` formula for `y`.\n\n#### Task 4.2\n\nCopy from Task 4.1 the code to run one trial. (Make sure to take out the comment symbol!)\n\nThen modify the copied code to place the one-trial code in curly braces, and use `do(10)*` to run ten trials.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For Task 4.2\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy trial and error, find a sample size $n$ that's large enough so that the coefficients from the trials reliably match those in the `y` formula from `dag02`, varying by at most by $\\pm 0.1$. How big a sample is required for this?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\nRepeat the previous, but find a sample size large enough so that the coefficients differ from those in the `y` formula by at most $\\pm 0.01$. How big a sample is required for this?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n\n### Going further \n\nYou can create your own DAGs. Use `dag_make()`, which takes tilde expressions as arguments. The left-hand side of each tilde expression is the name of a node. The right-hand side is an arithmetical formula to create a value from that node from the values of previous nodes or exogenous random number generators like `exo()`. (See the help page `?dag_make` for more information.) For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_own_dag <- dag_make(\n  node_1 ~ exo(0.01) + 3,\n  second ~ 2*node_1 + exo(0.1) - 5,\n  node_C ~ 10*(node_1 + second) + exo() \n)\ndag_draw(my_own_dag)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-notes-lesson-20_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(my_own_dag)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nnode_1 ~ exo(0.01) + 3\nsecond ~ 2 * node_1 + exo(0.1) - 5\nnode_C ~ 10 * (node_1 + second) + exo()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(my_own_dag, size=10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 Ã— 3\n   node_1 second node_C\n    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1   3.00  0.929   39.2\n 2   3.02  1.28    42.9\n 3   2.99  0.918   38.7\n 4   3.02  0.883   38.3\n 5   3.01  0.905   37.5\n 6   3.00  1.04    39.2\n 7   3.01  0.956   39.7\n 8   3.01  0.951   39.8\n 9   2.99  1.03    42.0\n10   3.00  1.07    40.4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that by using a node on the right-hand side of a tilde expression only when it has already been created by a previous tilde expression, you guarantee that the graph will be acyclic.\n\n#### Optional task\n\nCreate a DAG that has the same arrangement of causal connections as \"[Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine),\" illustrated below:\n\n![](Professor-Butts.png)\n\nProfessor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin (1931). `Soup_spoon` (A) is raised to mouth, pulling `string` (B) and thereby jerking `ladle` (C), which throws `cracker` (D) past `toucan` (E). Toucan jumps after cracker and `perch` (F) tilts, upsetting `seeds` (G) into `pail` (H). Extra weight in pail pulls `cord` (I), which opens and ignites `lighter` (J), setting off `skyrocket` (K), which causes `sickle` (L) to cut `string_m` (M), allowing pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby `wiping_chin`.\n\n\n***\n\n## Documenting software \n\n  * File creation date: 2022-12-27\n  * R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\n\n\n",
