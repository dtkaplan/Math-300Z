Make any changes in that directory.\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1 Use the *response vs. explanatory* (**RESPEX**) format for data graphics, employing jittering as appropriate. Display density distributions using a violin graphic.\n\n19.2 Use the *variance* to measure the amount of variation in a quantitative variable. \n    a. Convert a *variance* into the corresponding *standard deviation*. \n    b. Properly display a standard deviation on a RESPEX-format graph.\n\n19.3 Compute, interpret, and display the *fitted model values* and the *residuals*. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## In DRAFT: \"Fitted model values\"\nMake sure this appears in the text. Also, RESPEX. \n:::\n\n19.4 Generate graphics and models using zero-one encoding of a categorical response variable. Interpret the output of such models.\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1 Construct sampling trials from a data frame or a simulation. \n\n20.2 Replicate sampling trials and calculate the amount of sampling variability.\n\n20.3 Recognize properties of directed, acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1 Use model training to separate signal from noise in a response variable. \n\n21.2 Recognize that the same training data will show a different signal depending on what model specification is used. \n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1 Describe the logical origin of sampling variation as the variation between multiple samples from the same source.\n\n22.2 Recognize the several formats in which we describe sampling variation---sampling variance, standard error, margin of error, confidence interval---and show how they are related. \n\n22.3 Identify how sampling variance scales with sample size $n$ and use this to estimate---given a single sample---how large the sampling variation would be in a sample of a different size.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.1 Construct and interpret confidence intervals on model coefficients and relate the intervals to the sampling distribution.\n\n23.2 Recognize that confidence intervals are only about sampling variation. They do not measure or summarize bias.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.1 Calculate the effect size *with respect to* a specified variable from regression models of one and multiple variables.\n\n24.2 State the units of an effect size given the units of the input and output of the model.\n\n24.3 Be able to hold a covariate \"constant\" in the calculation of effect size.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.1 Given a data frame, construct a predictor function for a specified response variable.\n\n25.2 Use the predictor function to estimate prediction error and summarize with root mean square (RMS) error. Relate this to a prediction interval.\n\n25.3 Distinguish between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction estimates of prediction error. \n\n25.4 Distinguish between the two settings for decision-making: \n\n    a. **Prediction**: predict an outcome for an individual\n    b. **Relationship**: characterize a relationship with an eye toward intervention or a better understanding of how a mechanism works.\n    \n    Given a research question, identify whether it corresponds to a prediction setting or a relationship setting.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.1 In evaluating a model function, generate a prediction interval.\n\n26.2 Interpret prediction bands as a series of intervals, one for each value of the model input.\n\n26.3 Identify the two components that make up a prediction error, one that scales with $n$ and the other that doesn't.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a QR day.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28.1 Read a DAG to determine which covariates to include in a model to reduce (out-of-sample) prediction error.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.1 Correctly define \"covariate\".\n\n29.2 Understand why including covariates---even spurious ones---always improves the appearance of model performance in in-sample testing.\n\n29.3 Read a DAG to anticipate when using spurious covariates will improve or will worsen model performance on out-of-sample prediction.\n\n29.4 Calculate amount of in-sample mean square error reduction to be expected with a useless (random) covariate. (Residual sum of squares divided by residual degrees of freedom.)\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.1 Identify confounding in a DAG\n\n30.2 Choose whether to include covariate depending on form of DAG\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.1 Distinguish \"common cause\" and \"collider\" forms of DAG.\n\n31.2 Construct appropriate DAG to match a narrative hypothesis.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32.1 Properly use nomenclature of experiment.\n\n32.2 Correctly re-draw DAG for an ideal experimental intervention.\n\n32.3 Use blocking to set assignment to treatment or control.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33.1. Distinguish between absolute and relative risk and identify when a change in risk is being presented as absolute or relative.\n\n33.2. Calculate and correctly interpret other presentations of differences in risk: population attributable fraction, NTT, odds ratio.\n\n33.3. Interpret effect size as stated in log odds.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.1. Build a classifier from case-control data.\n\n34.2. Cross-tabulate classifier results versus true state. Evaluate false-positive rate, false-negative rate, accuracy.\n\n34.3. Calculate different forms of conditional probability: p(A|B) versus p(B|A) and identify which form of conditional probability is useful for prediction of an individual's outcome.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35.1 Explain why case-control data may not give an proper measure of \"prevalence.\"\n\n35.2 Understand sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities.\n\n35.3 Calculate false-positive and false-negative rates for a given prevalence.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36.1 Understand and use properly hypothesis testing nomenclature: test statistic, sampling distribution under the null, Type-1 and Type-2 error, rejection threshold, p-value\n\n36.2 Contrast hypothesis testing versus Bayesian framework. \n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37.1 The permutation test\n\n37.2 Interpret correctly from regression/ANOVA reports\n\n37.3 Traditional names for hypothesis tests in different \"textbook\" settings.\n\n37.4.
