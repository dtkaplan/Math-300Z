The sampling process leaves traces---called **sampling variation***---in the models we construct from data. This Lesson gives you simulation tools to observe and quantify sampling variation. We will use these throughout the Lessons that follow.\n\n\n### Reading \n\n[Lesson **20** from *LST*](https://dtkaplan.github.io/Math-300R/Textbook/Reading-notes-lesson-20.html)\n\n\n\n### Objectives\n\n\n20.1 Construct sampling trials from a data frame or a simulation. \n\n20.2 Replicate sampling trials and calculate the amount of sampling variability.\n\n20.3 Recognize properties of directed, acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n\n\n[Updated list of objectives](../Objectives/Obj-lesson-20.html)\n\n### Libraries \n\n```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}\nlibrary(mosaic)\nlibrary(math300)\ndata(\"Whickham\", package=\"mosaicData\")\n```\n\n--------\n\n\nLesson \n--------\n\nIn the real world, creating a sample can be a laborious process, perhaps requiring field, experimental work, or building instrumentation. We're going to skip the hard stuff, and simply use the R function `sample()` which can create a sample from a data frame or a DAG (or other things such as the `1:10` in the example).\n\n```{r}\nsample(1:10, size = 4)\n```\n\nNote: The `size=` argument specifies the size of the sample to be collected. In the text, we follow statistical convention and always refer to the sample size with the letter $n$, as in \"collect a sample of size $n=6$. But `sample()` does *not* use $n$ as the name of the size-setting argument.\n\n### Exercise 1\n\n#### Task 1.1\n\nWrite the R command to take a sample of size $n = 5$ from the `Whickham` data frame.\n\n```{r}\n# for Task 1.1\n```\n\nAnswer these questions:\n\n- Does `sample()` select from the rows or the columns of a data frame?\n- Will the same `sample()` command, when repeated, return the same sample?\n\n\n#### Task 1.2\n\nCompare the ages of the smokers and non-smokers in `Whickham` with this model:\n\n`r options(digits=3)`\n\n```{r}\n# lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef()\n```\n\nNote the `smokerYes` coefficient is about -4.0. Interpret the `smokerYes` coefficient in everyday language to explain what it says about the ages of smokers and non-smokers. \n\n*Your answer*: \n\n#### Task 1.3\n\nMake an appropriate RESPEX-format graph of `Whickham` suited to the model `age ~ smoker`. Add a violin layer to the data layer. (Make sure to set the transparency `alpha` and the `fill` and `color` for an intelligible display.)\n\n```{r}\n# For task 1.3\n\n```\n\nFrom the graph, explain in everyday language why the violin is so narrow for smokers aged 65 and above.\n\n*Your answer*:\n\nWhy is there a waist in the violin for non-smokers at age 50, while the violin for smokers has a corresponding bulge? Explain in everyday language.\n\n*Your answer*:\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n#### Task 2.1\n\nWrite an R statement that will find the sample size $n$ of `Whickham`.\n\n```{r}\n# Find sample size of `Whickham`.\n```\n\nIn the chunk below, copy the code from Task 1.1 to display the coefficients from the model `age ~ smoker`. But modify the code so that instead of using all of `Whickham` as training data, a sample size of $n=50$.\n\n```{r}\n# Copy your code from Task 1.1, but set the sample size to n=50.\n```\n\nRun the above chunk several times, each time noting the coefficient `smokerYes`. The coefficient will differ from run to run: that's sampling variation. Which of these statements best describes the pattern? (Mark your answer **in bold**.)\n\na. The coefficients are always less than -4.0.\nb. The coefficients are always greater than -4.0\nc. The coefficients are scattered on both sides of -4.0.\n\n\n\n\n#### Task 2.2\n\nCopy your graphics code from Task 1.2, but modify it to set the sample size to $n=50$. \n```{r}\n# Copy the graphics code from Task 1.2, modified for a sample of size n=50.\nggplot(sample(Whickham, size=50), aes(x=smoker, y=age)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha=0.5, width=0.2) + \n  geom_violin(alpha=0.2, fill=\"blue\", color=NA)\n```\n\nRepeat the command many times, each time checking the violin for signs of the non-smoker waist and smoker bulge at around age 50. \n\na. Does the waist-bulge pattern appear reliably for a sample of size $n=50$?  \nb. Find a sample size at which the waist-bulge pattern occurs at least 3/4 of the time?\n    \n*Your answer here:*\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nIn this exercise, you will practice with the `do()` function that lets you run multiple replications of a trial. \n\n#### Task 3.1\n\nIn this task, the trial will be very simple: Fit the `age ~ smoker` model to `Whickham` and display the coefficients. The code to run a trial is inside the curly braces `{ }`. The `do()` function goes before the curly braces. There is always a `*` sign between `do()` and the curly braces.\n\n```{r}\n# Trials <- do(5) * { lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef() }\n# Trials\n```\n\nThe collection of `Trials` is a data frame that includes the results from each trial, stacked one above the next.\n\nYou may be surprised to see that the columns of `Trials` repeat the same number over and over again. Explain what it is about the command inside the `{ }` that causes the result to be the same every time the trial is run. (See the next task if you can't figure it out.)\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n#### Task 3.2\n\nThe typical use for `do()` is to repeat trials, each of which involves some random component, such as drawing a sample.\n\nModify the code from Task 3.1 so that the training data is a sample of size $n=50$ from `Whickham`. Also, modify the argument to `do()` so that there will be 10 rows in `Trials`.\n\n```{r}\n# modify this code\n# Trials <- do(5) * { lm(age ~ smoker, data=Whickham) %>% coef() }\n# Trials\n```\n\nConfirm that the coefficients vary from trial to trial, that is, from one sample to another.\n\nTry several different sample sizes (that is, $n=100, 200, 300$). Does the amount of trial-to-trial variation in the coefficients get bigger or smaller as the sample size increases?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nYou can use `sample()` to take samples from a DAG. For instance, consider\n`dag02`:\n\n```{r}\ndag_draw(dag02)\nprint(dag02)\nsample(dag02, size=5)\n```\n\n#### Task 4.1\n\nHere is the code for a single trial in which a sample of size $n=5$ is collected from `dag02` and used to train the model `y ~ a + x`, which corresponds exactly to the formula for `y` in the DAG.\n\n```{r}\n# lm(y ~ a + x, data=sample(dag02, size=5)) %>% coef()\n```\n\nNotice that the coefficients roughly match those in the `dag02` formula for `y`.\n\n#### Task 4.2\n\nCopy from Task 4.1 the code to run one trial. (Make sure to take out the comment symbol!)\n\nThen modify the copied code to place the one-trial code in curly braces, and use `do(10)*` to run ten trials.\n\n```{r}\n# For Task 4.2\n\n```\n\nBy trial and error, find a sample size $n$ that's large enough so that the coefficients from the trials reliably match those in the `y` formula from `dag02`, varying by at most by $\\pm 0.1$. How big a sample is required for this?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\nRepeat the previous, but find a sample size large enough so that the coefficients differ from those in the `y` formula by at most $\\pm 0.01$. How big a sample is required for this?\n\n*Your answer here*:\n\n\n### Going further \n\nYou can create your own DAGs. Use `dag_make()`, which takes tilde expressions as arguments. The left-hand side of each tilde expression is the name of a node. The right-hand side is an arithmetical formula to create a value from that node from the values of previous nodes or exogenous random number generators like `exo()`. (See the help page `?dag_make` for more information.) For example:\n\n```{r}\nmy_own_dag <- dag_make(\n  node_1 ~ exo(0.01) + 3,\n  second ~ 2*node_1 + exo(0.1) - 5,\n  node_C ~ 10*(node_1 + second) + exo() \n)\ndag_draw(my_own_dag)\nprint(my_own_dag)\nsample(my_own_dag, size=10)\n```\n\nNotice that by using a node on the right-hand side of a tilde expression only when it has already been created by a previous tilde expression, you guarantee that the graph will be acyclic.\n\n#### Optional task\n\nCreate a DAG that has the same arrangement of causal connections as \"[Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine),\" illustrated below:\n\n![](Professor-Butts.png)\n\nProfessor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin (1931). `Soup_spoon` (A) is raised to mouth, pulling `string` (B) and thereby jerking `ladle` (C), which throws `cracker` (D) past `toucan` (E). Toucan jumps after cracker and `perch` (F) tilts, upsetting `seeds` (G) into `pail` (H). Extra weight in pail pulls `cord` (I), which opens and ignites `lighter` (J), setting off `skyrocket` (K), which causes `sickle` (L) to cut `string_m` (M), allowing pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby `wiping_chin`.\n\n\n***\n\n## Documenting software \n\n  * File creation date: `r Sys.Date()`\n  * `r R.version.string`\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":{"pdf_document":{"toc":"yes"},"html_document":{"theme":"lumen","toc":"yes","toc_float":"yes"}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../mathjax-definitions.html"],"output-file":"Student-notes-lesson-20.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","title":"Math 300 Lesson 20 Notes","subtitle":"Simulation and sampling variation ","author":"YOUR NAME HERE","date":"`r format(Sys.time(), '%B, %Y')`"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
