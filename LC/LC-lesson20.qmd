## 20.1

@sec-size-of-variable describes two very closely related summary quantities used to measures of the "size" of a variable: i. the variance and ii. the "standard deviation" (which is the square root of the variance.

i. Using software, what is the variance of the XXX variable in the YYY data frame? Make sure to include the *units*.
ii. What is the "standard deviation" of the XXX variable? Calculate this in two different ways: i. "by-hand" taking of the square root of the variance; ii. using the `sd()` software directly.

[Repeat for a number of variables from different data frames.]
