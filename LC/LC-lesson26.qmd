Ideas

1. Construct prediction interval when evaluating a model function.
2. Plot a prediction band.
3. Check the consistency of the prediction band with the DAG mechanism for large $n$.
    - Is the width right?
    - Is the slope right?
4. For small $n$ (say, $n=5$), how is the prediction band different than for large $n$?
