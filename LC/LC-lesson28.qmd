## Remove these hard-coded objectives after drafting problems

28.1 Read a DAG to determine which covariates to include in a model to reduce (out-of-sample) prediction error.

28.2 Calculate amount of in-sample mean square error reduction to be expected with a useless (random) covariate. (Residual sum of squares divided by residual degrees of freedom.)
:::


## 28.1

Consider `dag01`, which shows a simple causal relationship between two variable.

```{r}
dag_draw(dag01)
```

So far as the size of prediction error is concerned, does it matter whether `x` is used to predict `y` or vice versa? Show the models and the results you use to come to your conclusion.

## 28.B

Whenever you seek to study a partial relationship, there must be at
least three variables involves: a response variable, an explanatory
variable that is of direct interest, and one or more other explanatory
variables that will be held constant: the covariates.  Unfortunately,
it's hard to graph out models involving three variables on paper: the
usual graph of a model just shows one variable as a function of a
second.

One way to display the relationship between a response variable and
two quantitative explanatory variables is to use a contour plot.  The
two explanatory variables are plotted on the axes and the fitted model
values are shown by the contours.  @fig-car-modelC shows such a display of
the fitted model of used car prices as a function of
`mileage` and `age`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-car-modelC
knitr::include_graphics("images/car-modelC.png")
```


The dots are the `mileage` and `age` of the
individual cars --- the model `Price` is indicated by the
contours.  

The total relationship between `Price` and
`mileage` involves how the price changes for typical cars
of different mileage.  

1. Pick a dot that is a typical car with about
10,000 miles.  Using the contours, find the model price of this car.
Which of the following is closest to the model price (in dollars)?

18000, 21000, 25000, **30000**

2. Pick another dot that is a typical car with about 70,000 miles.
Using the contours, find the model price of this car. Which of the following is closest to the model price?

18000 **21000**, 25000, 30000

The total relationship between
`Price` and `mileage` is reflected by this
ratio: change in model price divided by change in mileage.
What is that ratio (roughly)?

a. **$\frac{30000 - 21000}{70000-10000}=0.15$ dollars/mile**
#. $\frac{70000-10000}{25000-21000}=15.0$ dollars/mile
#. $\frac{25000 - 18000}{70000-10000}=0.12$ dollars/mile


In contrast, the partial relationship between 
`Price` and `mileage` holding
`age` constant is found in a different way, by comparing
two points with different mileage but exactly the same age.

3. Mark a point on the graph where age is 3 years and mileage is
10000. Keep in mind that this point doesn't need to be an actual car,
that is, a data point in the graph typical car.  There might be no
actual car with an age of 3 years and mileage 10000.
But using the contour model, 
find the model price at this point. Which of these is closest?

22000, 24000, 26000 **28000**, 30000

 
4. Find another point, one where the age is exactly the same (3
years) but the mileage is different.  Again there might not be an
actual car there.  Let's pick mileage as 80000.
Using the contours, find the model price at this point. Which of these is closest?

**22000**, 24000, 26000, 28000, 30000

5. The partial relationship between price and mileage (holding age
constant) is reflected again reflected by the ratio of the change in
model price divided by the change in mileage. What is that ratio
(roughly)?

a. $\frac{80000-10000}{25000-21000} = 17.50$ dollars/mile
#. **$\frac{28000 - 22000}{80000-10000}=0.09$ dollars/mile**
#. $\frac{26000 - 24000}{80000-10000}=0.03$ dollars/mile

--------

Both the total relationship and the partial relationship are indicated
by the slope of the model price function given by the contours.  The
total relationship involves the slope between two points that are
typical cars, as indicated by the dots.  The partial relationship
involves a slope along a different direction.  When holding age
constant, that direction is the one where mileage changes but age does
not (vertical in the graph).  

There's also a partial relationship
between price and age holding mileage constant.  That partial
relationship involves the slope along the direction where age changes
but mileage is held constant.  Estimate that slope by finding the
model price at a point where age is 2 years and another point where
age is 5 years.  You can pick whatever mileage you like, but it's key
that your two points be at exactly the same mileage.

6. Estimate the slope of the price function along a direction where age
changes but mileage is held constant (horizontally on the graph).

a. 100 dollars per year
#. 500 dollars per year
#. **1000 dollars per year**
#. 2000 dollars per year

The contour plot in @fig-car-modelC depicts a model in which both mileage and age are
explanatory variables.  By choosing the direction in which to measure
the slope, one determines whether the slope reflects a total
relationship (a direction between typical cars), or a partial
relationship holding age constant (a direction where age does not
change, which might not be typical for cars), or a partial
relationship holding mileage constant (a direction where mileage does
not change, which also might not be typical for cars). 

In calculus, the partial derivative of price with respect to mileage
refers to an infinitesimal change in a direction where age is held
constant.  Similarly, the partial derivative of price with respect to
age refers to an infinitesimal change in a direction where mileage is
held constant.

Of course, in order for the directional derivatives to make sense, the
price function needs to have **both** age and mileage as explanatory
variables.  @fig-car-modelA shows a model in which only
`age` has been used as an explanatory variable: there is
no dependence of the function on `mileage`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-car-modelA
knitr::include_graphics("images/car-modelA.png")
```

Such a model is incapable of distinguishing between a partial
relationship and a total relationship.  Both the partial and the total
relationship involve a ratio of the change in price and change in age
between two points.  For the total relationship, those two points
would be typical cars of different ages.  For the partial
relationship, those two points would be different ages at exactly the
same mileage.  But, because the model depend on mileage, the
two ratios will be exactly the same.

## 28.C

In each of the following, a situation is described and a question is
asked that is to be answered by modeling.  Several variables are
listed. Imagine an appropriate model and identify each variable as
either the response variable, an explanatory variable, a covariate, or
a variable to be ignored.

> EXAMPLE: *Some people have claimed that police foot patrols are more 
effective at reducing the crime rate than patrols done in
automobiles.  Data from several different cities is available; each
city has its own fraction of patrols done by foot, its own crime rate,
etc.  The mayor of your town has asked for your advice on whether it
would be worthwhile to shift to more foot patrols in order to reduce
crime.  She asks, "Is there evidence
that a larger fraction of foot patrols reduces the crime rate?"*

**Variables**:

#. Crime rate (e.g., robberies per 100000 population)
#. Fraction of foot patrols
#. Number of policemen per 1000 population
#. Demographics (e.g., poverty rate)


Answer: The question focuses on how the `fraction of foot patrols` might
influence `crime rate`, so `crime rate` is the response variable and
`fraction of foot patrols` is an explanatory variable.

But, the crime rate might also depend on the overall level of policing
(as indicated by the `number of policemen`), or on the social
conditions that are associated with crime (e.g., `demographics`).
Since the mayor has no power to change the demographics of your town,
and probably little power to change the overall level number of
policemen, in modeling the data from the different cities, you
would want to hold constant `number of policemen` and the
`demographics`.  You can do this by treating `number of policemen` and `demographics` as covariates and including them in
your model.

### Alcohol and Road Safety

Fifteen years ago, your state legislature raised the legal drinking age
from 18 to
21 years.  An important motivation was to reduce the number of car accident
deaths due to drunk or impaired drivers.  Now, some people are arguing
that the 21-year age limit encourages binge drinking among 18 to 20
year olds and that such binge drinking actually increases car accident
deaths.  But the evidence is that the number of car accident deaths
has gone down since the 21-year age restriction was introduced.  
You are asked to examine the issue: Does the reduction in the number
of car-accident deaths per year point to the effectiveness of the
21-year drinking age?


**Variables**:

#. Drinking age limit. Levels: 18 or 21.

Which is it? response **explanatory** covariate ignore 

#. Number of car-accident deaths per year.

Which is it? **response** explanatory covariate ignore 

#. Prevalence of seat-belt use.

Which is it? response explanatory **covariate** ignore 

#. Fraction of cars with air bags.

Which is it? response explanatory **covariate** ignore 

#. Number of car accidents (with or without death).

Which is it? response explanatory covariate **ignore**


::: {.callout-note} 
## Explanation
Of direct interest is how the `drinking age limit` accounts for the
`number of deaths`, so these are, respectively, explanatory and
response variables.  But a lower death rate might also be explained by
increased use of `seat belts` and of `air bags`; these can
prevent deaths in an accident and they have been increasing over the
same period in which the 21-year age limit was introduced.  
In examining how the 
`drinking age limit` might affect the `number of deaths`, it
might be important to hold these other factors constant.  So, `seat belts` and `air bags` should be covariates included in the model.

The `number of accidents` is different.  It seems plausible that
the mechanism by which drunk driving causes deaths is by causing
accidents.  If the `number of accidents` were included as a
covariate, then the model would be examining how the death rate
changes with drinking age when {\em holding the number of accidents
constant} even though the point is
that the higher drinking age might reduce the number of accidents.
So, `number of accidents` ought to be left out of the model.

### Rating Surgeons

Your state government wants to guide citizens in choosing physicians.
As part of this effort, they are going to rank all the surgeons in
your state.  You have been asked to build the rating system and you
have a set of variables available for your use.  These variables have
been measured for each of the 342,861 people who underwent surgery in
your state last year: one person
being treated by one doctor.  How should you
construct a rating system that will help citizens to choose the most
effective surgeon for their own treatment?


**Variables**:

#. Outcome score. (A high score means that the operation did whatit was supposed to.  A low score  reflects failure, e.g. death. Death is a very bad outcome, post-operative infection a somewhat bad outcome.)

Which is it? **response** explanatory covariate ignore 

#. Surgeon.  One level for each of the operating surgeons.

Which is it? response explanatory covariate ignore 

#. Experience of the surgeon.

Which is it? response explanatory covariate **ignore**

#. Difficulty of the case.

Which is it? response explanatory **covariate** ignore 

::: {.callout-note} 
## Explanation

The patient has a choice of doctors and wants to have the best
possible outcome.  So the model needs to include `surgeon` as an
explanatory variable and `outcome score` as the response.  

A simple model might be misleading for informing a patient's choice.
The best doctors might take on the most difficult cases and
therefore have worse outcomes than doctors who are not as good. But
the patient's condition doesn't change depending on what doctor is
selected. This
means that the `difficulty of the case` ought to be included as a
covariate.  The model would thus tell what is the typical outcome for
each surgeon *adjusting for the difficulty of the case*, that is,
given the patient's condition.

Another variable that might explain the outcome is the `experience of the surgeon`; possibly more experienced surgeons produce better
outcomes.  However, `experience of the surgeon`  
should not be included in the model used to inform a patient's choice.  The
reason is that the patient's choice of a doctor already reflects the
experience of that doctor. From the patient's point of view, it
doesn't matter whether the doctor's outcomes reflect a high level of
talent, a lot of experience, or superior training.

The choice of variables and covariates depends on the purpose of the
model.  If the purpose of the model were to decide how much experience
to require of doctors before they are licensed, then an appropriate
model would have `outcome` as the response, `experience` as the
explanatory variable, and `difficulty of the case` and `surgeon`
as covariates.

### School testing

Last year, your school district hired a new superintendent to ``shake
things up.''  He did so, introducing several controversial new
policies.  At the end of the year, test scores were higher than last year.  A
representative of the teachers' union has asked you to examine the
score data and answer this question: Is there reason to think that the
higher scores were the result of the superintendent's new policies?


**Variables**:

#. Superintendent (levels: New or Former superintendent)

Which is it? response **explanatory** covariate ignore 

#. Exam difficulty

Which is it? response explanatory **covariate** ignore 

#. Test scores

Which is it? **response** explanatory covariate ignore 


::: {.callout-note} 
## Explanation
The issue of direct interest is whether the policies of the new
superintendent might have influenced the test scores, so the model
should be `test scores` as the response and `superintendent` as an
explanatory variable.  Of course, one possible mechanism that might
have improved the scores, outside of the influence of the
superintendent's policies, is the test itself.  If it were easier this
year than last year, 
then it wouldn't be surprising that the test scores improved this year
even if the superintendent's policies had no effect.  So `exam difficulty` should be a covariate to be included in the model.

### Gravity

In a bizarre twist of time, you find yourself as Galileo's research
assistant in Pisa in 1605.  Galileo is studying gravity: Does
gravity accelerate all materials in the same
way, whether they be made of metal, wood, stone, etc.?  Galileo hired
you as his assistant because you have brought with you, from the 21st
century, a stop-watch with which to measure time intervals, a
computer, and your skill in statistical modeling.  All of these 
seem miraculous to him.  

He drops objects off the top of the Leaning
Tower of Pisa and you measure the following:


**Variables**

#. The size of the object (measured by its diameter).

Which is it? response explanatory **covariate** ignore 


#. Time of fall of the object.

Which is it? **response** explanatory covariate ignore 

#. The material from which the object is made (brass, lead, wood,
stone).

Which is it? response **explanatory** covariate ignore 


::: {.callout-note} 
## Explanation
Galileo wants to know how the `material` affects the `time` of fall of the
object.  These are the explanatory and response variables
respectively.  But the size of the object also has an influence, due
to air resistance. For instance, a tiny ball will fall more slowly
than a large ball.  So the `size of the object` should be a covariate.

##28.D

Polling organizations often report their results in tabular form, as in @fig-time-poll-2008. The basic question in the poll summarized in @fig-time-poll-2008 asked whether the respondant agrees with the statement,  "The US was a better place to live in the 1990s and will continue to decline."

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-time-poll-2008
#| fig-cap: "Results from a poll conducted by *Time* magazine. (Source: *Time*, July 28, 2008, p. 41)"
knitr::include_graphics("images/time-poll-july-2008.png")
```

The response variable here is "pessimism." In the report, there are three explanatory variables: race/ethnicity, income, and age. The report's breakdown is one explanatory variable at a time, meaning that it considers "total change" rather than "change holding other factors constant." This can be misleading when there are connections among the explanatory variables. For instance, relatively few
people in the 18 to 29 age group have high incomes.

Pollsters rarely make available the raw data they collected. This is unfortunate because it prevents others from looking at the data in different ways. For the purpose of this exercise, you'll use simulated data in the frame `math300::Econ_outlook_poll`. Of course, the simulation doesn't necessarily describe people's attitudes directly, but it does let you see how the conclusions drawn from the poll might have been different if the results for each explanatory variable had been presented in a way that adjusts for the other explanatory variables.


1. Construct the model `pessimism ~ age - 1`.  Look at the coefficients and choose the statement that best reflects the results. (In case you're wondering: The `-1` is convenient when the explanatory variable is categorical. It ensures that a coefficient is reported for each level of the `age` variable. You'll have to compare coefficients for different age groups to see a trend.)

#. **Middle aged people have lower pessimism than young or old people.**
#. Young people have the least pessimism.
#. There is no relationship between age and pessimism.


2. Now construct the model `pessimism ~ income - 1`.  Look at
the coefficients and choose the statement that best reflects the
results:

#. Higher income people are more pessimistic than low-income people.
#. **Higher income people are less pessimistic than low-income people.**
#. There is no relationship between income and pessimism.


3. Construct a model in which you can look at the relationship
between pessimism and age while *adjusting for* income.  That is, include income as a covariate in your model. Look at the coefficients from your model and choose the statement that
best reflects the results:

#. **Holding income constant, older people tend to have higher levels of pessimism than young people.**
#. Holding income constant, young people tend to have higher levels of pessimism than old people.
#. Holding income constant, there is no relationship between age and pessimism.


4. You can also interpret that same model to see the relationship between
pessimism and income while *adjusting for age*. Which of the following statements best reflects the results?  (Hint: make sure to pay attention to the sign of the coefficients.)

#. Holding age constant, higher income people are more pessimistic than low-income people.
#. **Holding age constant, higher income people are less pessimistic than low-income people.**
#. Holding age constant, there is no relationship between income and pessimism.

## 28.E




A study^[{\small Based on an example from Judea Pearl (2000) *Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference*, Cambridge Univ. Press, p. 175}] on drug D indicates that patients who were given the drug were **less** likely to recover from their condition C.  Here is a table
showing the overall results:



Drug  |  #  recovered  |  #  died  |  Recovery Rate 
:---------|-----:|-----:|------:
Given  |  1600  |  2400  |  40% 
Not given  |  2000  |  2000  |  50% 


Strangely, when investigators looked at the situation separately for males and females, they found that the drug **improves** recovery for each group:

\multicolumn{4}{c}{Females} 
Sex | Drug  |  num recovered  |  #  died  |  Recovery Rate 
:----::---------|-----:|-----:|------:
Sex | Drug  |  num recovered  |  #  died  |  Recovery Rate 
Females| Given  |  900  |  2100  |  30% 
  | Not given  |  200  |  800  |  20% 
e 
  |  |  |  |  
Males |  Given  |  700  |  300  |  70% 
  | Not given  |  1800  |  1200  |  60% 

1. Are the two tables consistent with one another in terms of the numbers reported?

2. Does the drug improve recovery or hinder recovery?

3. What advice would you give to a physician about whether or not to prescribe the drug to her patients?  Give enough of an explanation that the physician can judge whether your advice is reasonable.

## 28.F

Economists measure the inflation rate as a percent change in price per year.
Unemployment is measured as the fraction (percentage) of those who
want to work who are seeking jobs.

According to economists, in the short run --- say, from one year to
another --- there is a relationship between inflation and
unemployment: all other things being equal, as unemployment goes up,
inflation should go down.  (The relationship is called the "Phillips curve," but you don't need to know that or anything technical about economics to answer this question.)


1. If the Phillips-curve relationship is true, in the model
 ~ `Inflation ~ Unemployment`, what should be the sign of
the coefficient on `Unemployment`? positive, zero, **negative**

But despite the short term relationship, economists claim that In the
long run --- over decades --- unemployment and
inflation should be unrelated.  

2. If the long-run theory is true, in the model
 ~ `Inflation ~ Unemployment`, what should be the sign of
the coefficient on `Unemployment`? positive, **zero**, negative}

--------

The point of this exercise is to figure out how to arrange a model so
that you can study the short-term behavior of the relationship, or so
that you can study the long term relationship.

For your reference, @fig-inflation1 shows inflation and unemployment rates 
over about 30 years in the US.  Each point shows the inflation and unemployment rates during
one quarter of a year.  The plotting symbol indicates which of three decade-long periods the point falls into.


```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-inflation1
knitr::include_graphics("images/inflation-fig1.png")
```

The relationship between inflation and unemployment seems to be
different from one decade to another --- that's the short term. 

3. Which decade seems to violate the economists' Phillips Curve short-term
relationship? **A**, B, C, none, all



Using the modeling language, express these different possible
relationships between the variables `Inflation`,
`Unemployment`, and `Decade`, where the variable
`Decade` is a categorical variable with the three different
levels shown in the legend for the graph. 

4. Inflation depends on Unemployment in a way that doesn't change over
time.


#. `Inflation ~ Decade`
#. ** ~ `Inflation ~ Unemployment`**
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment + Decade`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment * Decade`


5. Inflation changes with the decade, but doesn't depend on Unemployment.


#. ** ~ `Inflation ~ Decade`**
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment + Decade`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment * Decade`


6. Inflation depends on Unemployment in the same way every decade, but
each decade introduces a new background inflation rate independent of
Unemployment.
 

#. `Inflation ~ Decade`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment`
#. ** ~ `Inflation ~ Unemployment + Decade`**
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment * Decade`


7. Inflation depends on Unemployment in a way that differs from decade to
decade.

#. `Inflation ~ Decade`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment`
#. `Inflation ~ Unemployment + Decade`
#. ** ~ `Inflation ~ Unemployment * Decade`**


--------

Whether a model examines the short-term or the long-term behavior is
analogous to whether a partial change or a total change is being considered.



8. Suppose you wanted to study the long-term relationship  between
inflation and unemployment.  Which of these is appropriate?

#. Hold `Decade` constant. (Partial change)
#. **Let `Decade` vary as it will. (Total change)**


9. Now suppose you want to study the short-term relationship.  Which of
these is appropriate?

#. **Hold `Decade` constant. (Partial change)**
#. Let `Decade` vary as it will. (Total change)
