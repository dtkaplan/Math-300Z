29.1 Correctly define "covariate".

29.2 Understand why including covariates---even spurious ones---always improves the appearance of model performance in in-sample testing.

29.3 Read a DAG to anticipate when using spurious covariates will improve or will worsen model performance on out-of-sample prediction.

29.4 Calculate amount of in-sample mean square error reduction to be expected with a useless (random) covariate. (Residual sum of squares divided by residual degrees of freedom.)
