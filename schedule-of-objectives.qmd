## Lessons 1-18

As done in Fall 2020. Possible revisions to those lessons is not a topic of this proposal.

## Lesson 19: Decisions with data

#. Distinguish between the two settings for decision-making: 

    a. **Prediction**: predict an outcome for an individual
    b. **Relationship**: characterize a relationship with an eye toward intervention or a better understanding of how a mechanism works.
    
#. Given a research question, identify whether it corresponds to a prediction setting or a relationship setting.

## Examples

i. What's the risk of falling ill? [Prediction]
ii. How will the risk of falling ill change if we eat more broccholi? [Relationship]
iii. Is there any reason to believe, based on the evidence at hand, that we should look more deeply into the possible benefits of broccholi? [Relationship]

## Lesson 20: Reality versus gaming {#gaming-intro}

#. Understand that gaming is a way of improving our skills and identifying potential opportunities and problems. 

#. Enumerate the four stages of the games we will use and identify which ones correspond to non-gaming, real-world work with data.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## The Four Stages
i. building the deck: Instructors provide a simulation of a mechanism that generates rows of a data frame.
ii. the deal: Some of these rows will be dealt to you, constituting the data you have to work with. [real-world]
iii. the play: Build models and extract results. [real-world]
iv. the reveal: Compare your results from (iii) either to the mechanism given in (i) or to more data generated by the simulation.

#. Distinguish between a sample, a row, and a sample of samples.

## Lesson 21: DAGs, noise, and simulation

#. Determine whether a proposed graph is directed and acyclic.

#. Read notation to identify response variable, explanatory variable, covariates, and effect sizes.

#. Characterize the magnitude of random noise.

<!-- normal, two-sided exponential, dicotomizer -->

#. Generate data from simulations and summarize variables individually.

## Lesson 22: Sampling variation 

#. Implement on the computer a procedure to generate a sample, calculate a regression model, and produce a summary.

#. Iterate the procedure and collect the summaries across iterations.

#. Graphically display the distribution of summaries and generate a compact numerical description ("confidence interval") of the sampling distribution.

## Lesson 23: Estimate sampling variation from a single sample

#. Use bootstrapping to estimate sampling variation.

#. Infer sampling variation from a regression table.

## Lesson 24: Effect size

#. Estimate an effect size from a regression model of the two variables.

#. Construct a confidence interval on the effect size.

#. Evaluate whether confidence interval indicates that estimated effect size is consistent with simulation.

#. Understand and use scaling of confidence interval length as a function of $n$.

## Lesson 25: Mechanics of prediction

#. Given a sample from a  DAG simulation, construct a predictor function for a specified response variable.

#. Use the predictor function to estimate prediction error on a given DAG sample and summarize with root mean square (RMS) error.

#. Distinguish between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction estimates of prediction error. 

## Lesson 26: Constructing a prediction interval

#. Identify the two components that make up a prediction error, one that scales with $n$ and the other that doesn't.

## Lesson 27: Covariates

#. Show that including covariates in a prediction model always reduces in-sample mean square residual, but may not reduce residuals out-of-sample. 

#. Given regression coefficients, calculate model degrees of freedom and residual degrees of freedom.

#. Calculate amount of in-sample mean square error reduction to be expected with a useless (random) covariate. (Residual sum of squares divided by residual degrees of freedom.)

## Lesson 28: Covariates eat variance

#. Construct F statistic as ratio of incremental increase in model mean square due to model term(s) divided by residual mean square. 

#. Use software to construct ANOVA report and correctly interpret F statistics for prediction model term selection.


## Lesson 29: Confounding

#. Identify confounding in a DAG

#. Choose whether to include covariate depending on form of DAG


## Lesson 30: Non-causal correlation

#. Distinguish "common cause" and "collider" forms of DAG.

#. Construct appropriate DAG to match a narrative hypothesis.

## Lesson 31: Experiment and random assignment

#. Properly use nomenclature of experiment.

#. Correctly re-draw DAG for an ideal experimental intervention.

#. Use blocking to set assignment to treatment or control.

## Lesson 32: Measuring and accumulating risk

#. Distinguish between absolute and relative risk and identify when a change in risk is being presented as absolute or relative.

#. Calculate and correctly interpret other presentations of differences in risk: population attributable fraction, NTT, odds ratio.

#. Interpret effect size as stated in log odds.

## Lesson 33: Constructing a classifier

#. Build a classifier from case-control data.

#. Cross-tabulate classifier results versus true state. Evaluate false-positive rate, false-negative rate, accuracy.

#. Calculate different forms of conditional probability: p(A|B) versus p(B|A) and identify which form of conditional probability is useful for prediction of an individual's outcome.

## Lesson 34: Accounting for prevalence

#. Explain why case-control data may not give an proper measure of "prevalence."

#. Convert 


## Lesson 35: Hypothesis testing

#. Understand and use properly hypothesis testing nomenclature: test statistic, sampling distribution under the null, Type-1 and Type-2 error, rejection threshold, p-value

#. Contrast hypothesis testing versus Bayesian framework. 


## Lesson 36: Calculating a p-value

#. The permutation test

#. Interpret correctly from regression/ANOVA reports

#. Traditional names for hypothesis tests in different "textbook" settings.

#. Distinguish between p-value and effect size, that is, "significance" and "substance."


## Lesson 37: False discovery with hypothesis testing

#. Identify signs of false discovery in a research paper.

#. Estimate how overall p-value should change when study is replicated.
