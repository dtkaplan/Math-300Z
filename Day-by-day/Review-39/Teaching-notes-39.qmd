## Many statistical tests?

Students in Stat 101 are introduced to many differently named statistical tests. Such as the one-sample p-test, two-sample p-test, one-sample t-test, paired t-test, two-sample t-tests, and simple regression test (and sometimes ANOVA, "non-parametric" versions" of the tests and the "chi-squared test." Since most researchers studied statistics in the Stat 101 style, they will use these names. But they are all equivalent to regression.[Logistic regression handles the most common setting for the chi-squared test.]

Students who take Stat 101 have to learn which test applies in which circumstance. To help them, flow-charts are available, like this one where the lozenges are the named tests.

There are **three** groups of blocks:

i. Unhighlighted
ii. <span style="background:rgba(0,0,255,.2);">Blue highlight</span>
iii. <span style="background:rgba(255,0,0,.2);">Red highlight</span>


Our flowchart is simpler. Ignore entirely the unhighlighted blocks. Then replace blue and red as indicated below. 

1. Select the response variable, explanatory variable of interest (let's call it "EVI") and covariates (as appropriate).^[Covariates not covered in Stat 101.]

2. Check whether any of the numerical variables in (1) is seriously non-normal.
    i. <span style="background:rgba(0,0,255,.2);">If so, apply a rank transformation (or box-cox).</span>
    
3. <span style="background:rgba(255,0,0,.2);">Fit regression model using specification from (1).</span>
    i. If *response* is two-level categorical, convert to zero-one variable. Use `glm()`.^[`z ~ x` not covered in Stat 101.] 
    ii. If there are no explanatory variables, use `response ~ 1` and look at the intercept coefficient.
    iii. If cases are paired, reduce pair to a single difference. More generally, use pair ID among the covariates.^[Not covered in 300Z.] [NEED BLOG POST.]
    
4. <span style="background:rgba(255,0,0,.2);">Select a summary method, depending on type of the EVI</span>:
    i. Numerical or two-level categorical: Use `conf_interval()` and look at the confidence interval for the EVI.^[Stat 101 uses the p-value.]
    ii. Multi-level categorical: Use `anova_summary()`.^[Barely reached in this year's 300Z, and typically the same is true in Stat 101.] [NEED BLOG POST]


## Confounding

Have Col. Horton tell the study of the concern about high numbers of NJPs (non-judicial proceedings for minor offenses) in the Global Strike Command. They were higher than in other commands.

But, stratifying by job category, it was found that the excess was attributable to the "police" job category, which had a much higher NJP rate than other categories. This is true across the Air Force. But there is a much larger proportion of police in the Global Strike Command than in other commands.  Simpson's paradox!
