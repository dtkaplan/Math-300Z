Have Col. Horton tell the study of the concern about high numbers of NJPs (non-judicial proceedings for minor offenses) in the Global Strike Command. They were higher than in other commands.

But, stratifying by job category, it was found that the excess was attributable to the "police" job category, which had a much higher NJP rate than other categories. This is true across the Air Force. But there is a much larger proportion of police in the Global Strike Command than in other commands.  Simpson's paradox!
