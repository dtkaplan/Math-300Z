Our emphasis will be on the data-analysis techniques that are useful for **decision-making**. What this means will become evident as we move through the semester, but I'll give two settings for decision-making:

1. Intervention in a system. (Lesson 24) There's a system that you are working with, perhaps aircraft design. You want to intervene in the system, to change something. You need to know how the change you impose will change the outcome.
    - Usually, we are interested in predictions that cover most of the likely outcomes.
    - Sometimes, we want to predict the probabilities of extreme events, for instance thousand-year floods.

2. Prediction. (Lessons 25 and 26)
