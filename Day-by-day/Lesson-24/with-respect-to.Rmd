## Math 300Z: In-class group activity

## With respect to ...

The `palmerpenguins::penguins` data frame records body size and shape of penguins of three different species.

1. Build a model `bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm` with a single quantitative explanatory variable. 

    - What is the effect size?
    - What are the units? Is it a rate or a difference?

2. Build a model `bill_length_mm ~ species` with a single categorical explanatory variable.

    - What is the effect size?
    - What are the units? Is it a rate or a difference?
    
3. Now a model `bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length + body_mass_g`. There are two variables, so there will be two effect sizes. 

    - What are the effect sizes? What are their units. 
    - Which of the two are rates?
