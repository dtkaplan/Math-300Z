## With respect to ...

Build a model with a single quantitative explanatory variable. Maybe `palmerpenguins::penguins` 

    - What is the effect size?
    - What are the units? Is it a rate or a difference?

Build a model with a single categorical explanatory variable.

    - What is the effect size?
    - What are the units? Is it a rate or a difference?
    
Combine the two and calculate effect sizes again.

    - Do the effect sizes change?
    - Do the units change? 
    - Is it still a rate?
    
Include many explanatory variables: Find the effect sizes with respect to each.
