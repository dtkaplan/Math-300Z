Tell the story of the Chinese spy balloon. After it was detected, the Air Force (according to news reports) increased the sensitivity of radars.  This led to an increase in detection and a week-long rash of high-altitude detections, two of which were shot down. Eventually it was realized that there is a surprising amount of stuff floating around at high altitude.  <https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/02/16/us/biden-china-balloon-ufo?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare>
