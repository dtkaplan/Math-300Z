## Math 300Z: In-class group activity

## Counts and waiting times

GENERATE SEQUENCES FROM POISSON and EXPONENTIAL.

First, generate a sample of size 1: find the largest and smallest across the class.

Then generate a sample of size 20:

- find the largest and smallest. are they pretty consistent across the class?
    - find the variance. Is that pretty consistent across the class?
- find the mean:
    - is that as spread out as the largest and smallest?
    - how spread out is it? (variance)

Keep a table

sample size | variance  | standard deviation
------------|-----------|---------------
20.         |           |
20          |           |
20          |           |
40          |           |
80          |           |


Maybe add a parameter or distribution argument to `sample.dag_system()`
