```{r include=FALSE}

```

On Sunday afternoon I was reading the AARP monthly newsletter. This short item drew my attention:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 30%
knitr::include_graphics("chest-pain.png")
```

This hat startling relevance because---at the time I was reading---I had no chest pain at all. Should I have been concerned? What is the probability I am having a heart attack if not 31%.

Heuristics: 
- **31% per what interval of time?** If I'm not having chest pain next week, do I still have a 31% probability of having a heart attack at that time? A probability quantifies a specific outcome from a specific event. Is there any guidance about what the specific event is? My whole future life? This month? Today?
- ... others from students.

<!--

**Formalism**:

- A probability is a number between 0 and 1 assigned to an individual outcome from an event with many possible outcomes. (Remember, the proper form for a prediction is to assign a probability to each possible outcome of the thing being predicted. The probabilities across all possible mutually exclusive outcomes add to 1.)

**Example**:

Simple events: Just one kind of outcome, e.g. a single number (which is mutually exclusive of the other possible numbers) or a categorical outcome. To keep things particular simple, let's consider two non-overlapping simple events:

- Example 1: Outcomes are "sick" or "healthy," for instance, having a heart attack or not having a heart attack.

- Example 2: Outcomes are "pain" or "no pain," as in chest pain.

However we define one of the outcomes, the complement is "anything but that."

Compound events: The outcomes are all the possible combinations of the outcomes of two (or more) simple events:

i. Sick & pain
#. Healthy & pain
#. Sick & no pain
#. Healthy & no pain

There are compound events that can be stated as a composition of these, e.g. 
- "sick or pain" is a combination of "sick & pain" + "sick & no pain" + "healthy & pain"
- "sick xor pain" is a combination of "sick & no pain" + "healthy & pain"

A **marginal probability** refers to a compound event. e.g. p(pain), likewise p(healthy). It is the probability of outcome for one event, *regardless* of which way the other event comes out.

A **conditional probability** also refers to a compound event. The probability of one event **given** that the other event has a particular value. Example: p(pain | sick). The "|" reads as "given."


 . | sick | healthy
Pain | 3 | 4
No pain | 5 | 6


The one I'm concerned about here is p(sick | no pain). This is:

p(sick | no pain) = p(no pain | sick) * p(sick) /p(no pain) = [p(no pain | sick) / p(no pain)] p (sick)

The quantity in square brackets is called the Bayes factor. Here, that is [(5/8)/(11/18)] = 1.02

Posterior is likelihood * prior

A "**likelihood**" is probability of some observable *given* the underlying condition.

Two likelihoods involved here: p(pain | sick) as well as p(pain | healthy)

These are likelihoods, not compound events.

 . | sick | healthy
Pain | 69% | 1%
No pain | 31% | 99%

Multiply the likelihood by the prior. Example p(sick) = 1% so p(healthy) = 99%

These are compound events
 . | sick | healthy
Pain | 0.69% | 0.1%
No pain | 0.31% | 98%

## Review of Lesson 30

**Child of response as covariate**

```{r}
dag_four <- dag_make(
  A ~ exo(),
  B ~ A + exo(),
  C ~ 2.5*B + exo()
)
Samp <- sample(dag_four, size=1000)
lm(B ~ A, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
lm(B ~ A + C, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
```



**Parent of explanatory as covariate**

```{r}
dag_six <- dag_make(
  C ~ exo(),
  A ~ C +  exo(),
  B ~ 2.5* A + exo()
)
Samp <- sample(dag_six, size=1000)
lm(B ~ A, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
lm(B ~ A + C, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
```

**Child of explanatory as covariate**

```{r}
dag_five <- dag_make(
  A ~ exo(),
  C ~ A +  exo(),
  B ~ 2.5* A + exo()
)
Samp <- sample(dag_five, size=1000)
lm(B ~ A, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
lm(B ~ A + C, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
```

**Collider

```{r}
dag_three <- dag_make(
  A ~ exo(),
  B ~ 2.5* A + exo(),
  C ~ A + 1.25*B +  exo()
)
Samp <- sample(dag_three, size=1000)
lm(B ~ A, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
lm(B ~ A + C, data=Samp) |> conf_interval()
```


## The Berkeley graduate admissions data from 1973

```{r}
mod1 <- model_train(zero_one(admit, one="admitted") ~ gender,
                    data=UCB_applicants)
model_plot(mod1, x=dept, color=gender, nlevels=10) +
  ylab("Admitted")
```

```{r}
mod2 <- model_train(zero_one(admit, one="admitted") ~ gender*dept,
                    data=UCB_applicants)
model_plot(mod2, x=dept, color=gender, nlevels=10, data_alpha=0.1) +
  ylab("Admitted")
```


```{r}
model_train(zero_one(admit, one="admitted") ~ gender, 
            data=UCB_applicants) |> conf_interval()
model_train(zero_one(admit, one="admitted") ~ gender + dept, 
            data=UCB_applicants) |> conf_interval()
```





## Back to Berkeley

Should we adjust for **department**? Let's go to a DAG.



```{r}
UCB_dag1 <- dag_make(sex ~ exo(),
                     dept ~ sex,
                     admit ~ sex + dept)
dag_draw(UCB_dag1, vertex.label.cex=1)
```

If we think that the connection sex $\longrightarrow$ department is just a matter of personal choice (as in the 1975 *Science* article), then we should block the back-door pathway.

But if we think that sex $\longrightarrow$ department reflects systemic issues such as which departments are considered important and get funding, or which careers women think they can succeed in, then we **do not** want to block the backdoor pathway.

```{r}
UCB_dag2 <- dag_make(sex ~ exo(),
                     success ~ sex,
                     dept_funding ~ sex,
                     dept ~ success,
                     admit ~ sex + dept + dept_funding)
dag_draw(UCB_dag2, vertex.label.cex=1)
```


## Birthweight collider


Observations from the 1960s:

- Smoking is associated with lower birthweight
- Lower birthweight is associated with increased mortality

Question: Does smoking have a direct effect on mortality?


```{dot}
digraph H {
  node [fontsize="5" shape="plain"];
  edge [penwidth="0.5" arrowsize="0.25" len="0.25"];
  Smoking -> "Birth weight" [color="blue"];
  "Birth weight" -> "Mortality of infant" [color="blue"];
  Smoking -> "Mortality of infant" [color="blue" label=" ?" labelfontcolor="blue" fontsize="5"];
}
```

How do you look at the direct effect of smoking on mortality? Block the other pathway by using birth weight as a covariate. 

When this was done, by looking only at low-birthweight babies, it was found that smoking *reduces* mortality.

Might there be something else going on? Is there another cause for low birthweight?

```{dot}
digraph J {
      node [fontsize="5" shape="plain"];
      edge [penwidth="0.5" arrowsize="0.25" len="0.25"];
      "Birth defect";
      Smoking;
      "Birth weight";
      "Mortality of infant";
      Smoking -> "Birth weight" [color="blue"];
      "Birth weight" -> "Mortality of infant" [color="blue"];
      Smoking -> "Mortality of infant" [color="blue"];
      "Birth defect" -> "Mortality of infant";
      "Birth defect" -> "Birth weight";
}
```




## Links by chance

Our method for detecting a link between variable `X` and `Y` is to build the model `Y ~ X`, with perhaps some covariate(s), then example the coefficient on `X`. If the *confidence interval** includes zero, there is no link.

We can simulate what happens when there is **no link**, for example

```{r}
no_link_dag <- dag_make(
  X ~ exo(),
  Y ~ exo()
)
```

How do we know this DAG represents a system with no link?

A simulation:

```{r}
Samp <- sample(no_link_dag, size=100)
lm(Y ~ X, data=Samp) |> 
  conf_interval() |>
  filter(term=="X")
```

Let's see how often we get a confidence interval that **excludes zero** even though there is no link between `X` and `Y` in the mechanism generating the data.

```{r}
one_trial <- function(n=100) {
  sample(no_link_dag, size=n) |>
    lm(Y ~ X, data=_) |>
    conf_interval() |>
    filter(term=="X") |> 
    mutate(excludes = .lwr > 0 | .upr < 0) |>
    select(excludes)
}
one_trial()
```

Now run 1000 trials ...

```{r}
{do(1000) * one_trial(n=100)} |> 
  summarize(frac_mistakes = sum(excludes) / n())
```

How will the fraction of mistakes change if we increase the sample size?

                    data=UCB_applicants)
